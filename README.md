When you contribute a docset, you need to edit this README to include the following:
### Abhinav Sharma [ https://github.com/abhi18av]
##### Download the HTML docs bundle from the ReadTheDocs website
- http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/

##### Fire up the terminal and move to the unzipped folder for the Pelican docs.

##### Use the following commands to initiate and build the Docset using the **Dashing**
- https://github.com/technosophos/dashing#readme

##### Add the docset to the documentation reader tool of your choice

##### ToDo
- Learn how to use the selectors to make bookmarks for the modules as well.
- Right now the Docset is a single HTML page.
