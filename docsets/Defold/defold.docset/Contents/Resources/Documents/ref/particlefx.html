How to play a particle fx when a game object is created:

Resetting a constant through this function implies that the value defined in the material will be used.
Which particle FX to reset a constant for is identified by the URL.</p><h3>PARAMETERS</h3><p>url - the particle FX that should have a constant reset (url)</p><p>emitter_id - the id of the emitter (string|hash)</p><p>name - the name of the constant (string|hash)</p><h3>EXAMPLES</h3><p><p>
The following examples assumes that the particle FX has id "particlefx", contains an emitter with id "emitter" and that the default-material in builtins is used.
If you assign a custom material to the emitter, you can reset the constants defined there in the same manner.

How to reset the tinting of particles from an emitter:
</p>
<pre>
function init(self)
    particlefx.reset_constant("#particlefx", "emitter", "tint")
end
</pre></p><h1><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Function/particlefx.set_constant' class='dashAnchor'></a><a name='particlefx.set_constant'>particlefx.set_constant()</a></h1><p>set a shader constant for a particle FX emitter</p><p>The constant must be defined in the material assigned to the emitter.
Setting a constant through this function will override the value set for that constant in the material.
The value will be overridden until particlefx.reset_constant is called.
Which particle FX to set a constant for is identified by the URL.</p><h3>PARAMETERS</h3><p>url - the particle FX that should have a constant set (url)</p><p>emitter_id - the id of the emitter (string|hash)</p><p>name - the name of the constant (string|hash)</p><p>value - the value of the constant (vec4)</p><h3>EXAMPLES</h3><p><p>
The following examples assumes that the particle FX has id "particlefx", contains an emitter with id "emitter" and that the default-material in builtins is used.
If you assign a custom material to the emitter, you can set the constants defined there in the same manner.
