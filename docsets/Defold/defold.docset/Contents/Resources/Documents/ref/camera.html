<h1><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Command/acquire_camera_focus' class='dashAnchor'></a><a name='acquire_camera_focus'>acquire_camera_focus</a></h1><p>makes the receiving camera become the active camera</p><p><p>
Post this message to a camera-component to activate it.
</p>
<p>
Several cameras can be active at the same time, but only the camera that was last activated will be used for rendering.
When the camera is deactivated (see <code>release_camera_focus</code>), the previously activated camera will again be used for rendering automatically.
</p>
<p>
The reason it is called "camera focus" is the similarity to how acquiring input focus works (see <code>acquire_input_focus</code>).
</p></p><h3>EXAMPLES</h3><p><p>
In the examples, it is assumed that the instance of the script has a camera-component with id "camera".

Post this message to a camera-component to deactivate it. The camera is then removed from the active cameras.
See <code>acquire_camera_focus</code> for more information how the active cameras are used in rendering.
