<h1><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Function/collectionfactory.create' class='dashAnchor'></a><a name='collectionfactory.create'>collectionfactory.create()</a></h1><p>Spawn a new instance of a collection into the existing collection.</p><p>The URL identifies the collectionfactory component that should do the spawning.

Spawning is instant, but spawned game objects get their first update calls the following frame. The supplied parameters for position, rotation and scale
will be applied to the whole collection when spawned.

Script properties in the created game objects can be overridden through
a properties-parameter table. The table should contain game object ids
(hash) as keys and property tables as values to be used when initiating each
spawned game object.

See go.property for more information on script properties.

The function returns a table that contains a key for each game object
id (hash), as addressed if the collection file was top level, and the
corresponding spawned instance id (hash) as value with a unique path
prefix added to each instance.</p><h3>PARAMETERS</h3><p>url - the collection factory component to be used (url)</p><p>[position] - position to assign to the newly spawned collection (vector3)</p><p>[rotation] - rotation to assign to the newly spawned collection (quat)</p><p>[properties] - table of script properties to propagate to any new game object instances (table)</p><p>[scale] - uniform scaling to apply to the newly spawned collection (must be greater than 0). (number)</p><h3>RETURN</h3><p>a table mapping the id:s from the collection to the new instance id:s</p><h3>EXAMPLES</h3><p><p>
How to spawn a collection of game objects:
</p>
<pre>
function init(self)
  -- Spawn a small group of enemies.
  local pos = vmath.vector3(100, 12.5, 0)
  local rot = vmath.quat_rotation_z(math.pi / 2)
  local scale = 0.5
  local props = {}
  props[hash("/enemy_leader")] = { health = 1000.0 }
  props[hash("/enemy_1")] = { health = 200.0 }
  props[hash("/enemy_2")] = { health = 400.0, color = hash("green") }

  local self.enemy_ids = collectionfactory.create("#enemyfactory", pos, rot, props, scale)
  -- enemy_ids now map to the spawned instance ids:
  --
  -- pprint(self.enemy_ids)
  --
  -- DEBUG:SCRIPT:
  -- {
  --   hash: [/enemy_leader] = hash: [/collection0/enemy_leader],
  --   hash: [/enemy_1] = hash: [/collection0/enemy_1],
  --   hash: [/enemy_2] = hash: [/collection0/enemy_2]
  -- }

  -- Send "attack" message to the leader. First look up its instance id.
  local leader_id = self.enemy_ids[hash("/enemy_leader")]
  msg.post(leader_id, "attack")
end
