<h1><a name='//apple_ref/cpp/Function/factory.create' class='dashAnchor'></a><a name='factory.create'>factory.create()</a></h1><p>make a factory create a new game object</p><p>The URL identifies which factory should create the game object.
If the game object is created inside of the frame (e.g. from an update callback), the game object will be created instantly, but none of its component will be updated in the same frame.

Properties defined in scripts in the created game object can be overridden through the properties-parameter below.
See go.property for more information on script properties.</p><h3>PARAMETERS</h3><p>url - the factory that should create a game object (url)</p><p>[position] - the position of the new game object, the position of the game object containing the factory is used by default (vector3)</p><p>[rotation] - the rotation of the new game object, the rotation of the game object containing the factory is used by default (quat)</p><p>[properties] - the properties defined in a script attached to the new game object (table)</p><p>[scale] - the scale of the new game object (must be greater than 0), the scale of the game object containing the factory is used by default (number or vector3)</p><h3>RETURN</h3><p>the global id of the spawned game object (hash)</p><h3>EXAMPLES</h3><p><p>
How to create a new game object:
</p>
<pre>
function init(self)
    self.my_created_object = factory.create("#factory", nil, nil, {my_value = 1})
    -- communicate with the object
    msg.post(msg.url(nil, self.my_created_object), "hello")
end
</pre>
<p>
And then let the new game object have a script attached:
</p>
<pre>
go.property("my_value", 0)

function init(self)
    -- do something with self.my_value which is now one
end
</pre></p>
