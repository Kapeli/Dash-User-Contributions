<span id="upgrading-chapter"></span><h1>Upgrading Pyramid<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-pyramid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When a new version of Pyramid is released, it will sometimes deprecate a
feature or remove a feature that was deprecated in an older release.  When
features are removed from Pyramid, applications that depend on those features
will begin to break.  This chapter explains how to ensure your Pyramid
applications keep working when you upgrade the Pyramid version you're using.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">About Release Numbering</p>
<p class="last">Conventionally, application version numbering in Python is described as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">major.minor.micro</span></tt>.  If your Pyramid version is &quot;1.2.3&quot;, it means
you're running a version of Pyramid with the major version &quot;1&quot;, the minor
version &quot;2&quot; and the micro version &quot;3&quot;.  A &quot;major&quot; release is one that
increments the first-dot number; 2.X.X might follow 1.X.X.  A &quot;minor&quot;
release is one that increments the second-dot number; 1.3.X might follow
1.2.X.  A &quot;micro&quot; release is one that increments the third-dot number;
1.2.3 might follow 1.2.2.  In general, micro releases are &quot;bugfix-only&quot;,
and contain no new features, minor releases contain new features but are
largely backwards compatible with older versions, and a major release
indicates a large set of backwards incompatibilities.</p>
</div>
<p>The Pyramid core team is conservative when it comes to removing features.  We
don't remove features unnecessarily, but we're human, and we make mistakes
which cause some features to be evolutionary dead ends.  Though we are
willing to support dead-end features for some amount of time, some eventually
have to be removed when the cost of supporting them outweighs the benefit of
keeping them around, because each feature in Pyramid represents a certain
documentation and maintenance burden.</p>
<div class="section" id="deprecation-and-removal-policy">
<h2>Deprecation and Removal Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#deprecation-and-removal-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a feature is scheduled for removal from Pyramid or any of its official
add-ons, the core development team takes these steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using the feature will begin to generate a <cite>DeprecationWarning</cite>, indicating
the version in which the feature became deprecated.</li>
<li>A note is added to the documentation indicating that the feature is
deprecated.</li>
<li>A note is added to the <a class="reference internal" href="../changes.html#changelog"><em>Pyramid Change History</em></a> about the deprecation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a deprecated feature is eventually removed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The feature is removed.</li>
<li>A note is added to the <a class="reference internal" href="../changes.html#changelog"><em>Pyramid Change History</em></a> about the removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Features are never removed in <em>micro</em> releases.  They are only removed in
minor and major releases.  Deprecated features are kept around for at least
<em>three</em> minor releases from the time the feature became deprecated.
Therefore, if a feature is added in Pyramid 1.0, but it's deprecated in
Pyramid 1.1, it will be kept around through all 1.1.X releases, all 1.2.X
releases and all 1.3.X releases.  It will finally be removed in the first
1.4.X release.</p>
<p>Sometimes features are &quot;docs-deprecated&quot; instead of formally deprecated.
This means that the feature will be kept around indefinitely, but it will be
removed from the documentation or a note will be added to the documentation
telling folks to use some other newer feature.  This happens when the cost of
keeping an old feature around is very minimal and the support and
documentation burden is very low.  For example, we might rename a function
that is an API without changing the arguments it accepts.  In this case,
we'll often rename the function, and change the docs to point at the new
function name, but leave around a backwards compatibility alias to the old
function name so older code doesn't break.</p>
<p>&quot;Docs deprecated&quot; features tend to work &quot;forever&quot;, meaning that they won't be
removed, and they'll never generate a deprecation warning.  However, such
changes are noted in the <a class="reference internal" href="../changes.html#changelog"><em>Pyramid Change History</em></a>, so it's possible to know that you
should change older spellings to newer ones to ensure that people reading
your code can find the APIs you're using in the Pyramid docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consulting-the-change-history">
<h2>Consulting the Change History<a class="headerlink" href="#consulting-the-change-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your first line of defense against application failures caused by upgrading
to a newer Pyramid release is always to read the <a class="reference internal" href="../changes.html#changelog"><em>Pyramid Change History</em></a>.  to find
the deprecations and removals for each release between the release you're
currently running and the one you wish to upgrade to.  The change history
notes every deprecation within a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Deprecation</span></tt> section and every removal
within a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Backwards</span> <span class="pre">Incompatibilies</span></tt> section for each release.</p>
<p>The change history often contains instructions for changing your code to
avoid deprecation warnings and how to change docs-deprecated spellings to
newer ones.  You can follow along with each deprecation explanation in the
change history, simply doing a grep or other code search to your application,
using the change log examples to remediate each potential problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-your-application-under-a-new-pyramid-release">
<span id="testing-under-new-release"></span><h2>Testing Your Application Under a New Pyramid Release<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-your-application-under-a-new-pyramid-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you've upgraded your application to a new Pyramid release and you've
remediated as much as possible by using the change history notes, you'll want
to run your application's tests (see <a class="reference internal" href="../tutorials/wiki/installation.html#running-tests"><em>Run the Tests</em></a>) in such a way that
you can see DeprecationWarnings printed to the console when the tests run.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>python -Wd setup.py <span class="nb">test</span> -q
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-Wd</span></tt> argument is an argument that tells Python to print deprecation
warnings to the console.  Note that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-Wd</span></tt> flag is only required for
Python 2.7 and better: Python versions 2.6 and older print deprecation
warnings to the console by default.  See <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-W">the Python -W flag documentation</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>As your tests run, deprecation warnings will be printed to the console
explaining the deprecation and providing instructions about how to prevent
the deprecation warning from being issued.  For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ python -Wd setup.py test -q
# .. elided ...
running build_ext
/home/chrism/projects/pyramid/env27/myproj/myproj/views.py:3:
DeprecationWarning: static: The &quot;pyramid.view.static&quot; class is deprecated
as of Pyramid 1.1; use the &quot;pyramid.static.static_view&quot; class instead with
the &quot;use_subpath&quot; argument set to True.
  from pyramid.view import static
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.014s

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the above case, it's line #3 in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myproj.views</span></tt> module (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span>
<span class="pre">pyramid.view</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">static</span></tt>) that is causing the problem:</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>The deprecation warning tells me how to fix it, so I can change the code to
do things the newer way:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>When I run the tests again, the deprecation warning is no longer printed to
my console:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ python -Wd setup.py test -q
# .. elided ...
running build_ext

<h2>My Application Doesn't Have Any Tests or Has Few Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#my-application-doesn-t-have-any-tests-or-has-few-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If your application has no tests, or has only moderate test coverage, running
tests won't tell you very much, because the Pyramid codepaths that generate
deprecation warnings won't be executed.</p>
<p>In this circumstance, you can start your application interactively under a
server run with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PYTHONWARNINGS</span></tt> environment variable set to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default</span></tt>.  On UNIX, you can do that via:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ PYTHONWARNINGS</span><span class="o">=</span>default <span class="nv">$VENV</span>/bin/pserve development.ini
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On Windows, you need to issue two commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>C:<span class="se">\&gt;</span> <span class="nb">set </span><span class="nv">PYTHONWARNINGS</span><span class="o">=</span>default
C:<span class="se">\&gt;</span> Scripts/pserve.exe development.ini
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point, it's ensured that deprecation warnings will be printed to the
console whenever a codepath is hit that generates one.  You can then click
around in your application interactively to try to generate them, and
remediate as explained in <a class="reference internal" href="#testing-under-new-release"><em>Testing Your Application Under a New Pyramid Release</em></a>.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONWARNINGS">the PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable documentation</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-W">the
Python -W flag documentation</a> for more
information.</p>

<div class="section" id="upgrading-to-the-very-latest-pyramid-release">
<h2>Upgrading to the Very Latest Pyramid Release<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-to-the-very-latest-pyramid-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you upgrade your application to the most recent Pyramid release,
it's advisable to upgrade step-wise through each most recent minor release,
beginning with the one that you know your application currently runs under,
and ending on the most recent release.  For example, if your application is
running in production on Pyramid 1.2.1, and the most recent Pyramid 1.3
release is Pyramid 1.3.3, and the most recent Pyramid release is 1.4.4, it's
advisable to do this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Upgrade your environment to the most recent 1.2 release.  For example, the
most recent 1.2 release might be 1.2.3, so upgrade to it.  Then run your
application's tests under 1.2.3 as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="#testing-under-new-release"><em>Testing Your Application Under a New Pyramid Release</em></a>.  Note any deprecation warnings and
remediate.</li>
<li>Upgrade to the most recent 1.3 release, 1.3.3.  Run your application's
tests, note any deprecation warnings and remediate.</li>
<li>Upgrade to 1.4.4.  Run your application's tests, note any deprecation
warnings and remediate.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you skip testing your application under each minor release (for example if
you upgrade directly from 1.2.1 to 1.4.4), you might miss a deprecation
warning and waste more time trying to figure out an error caused by a feature
removal than it would take to upgrade stepwise through each minor release.</p>
