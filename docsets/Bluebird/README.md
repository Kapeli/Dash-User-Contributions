## Docset Generation
https://github.com/giladgray/dash-bluebird-docset for instructions.

The GitHub repo includes the API.md file which I downloaded by hand from https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird. The generation script is a simple CoffeeScript file that compiles the markdown, processes the generated HTML file, and populates the Sqlite database.
