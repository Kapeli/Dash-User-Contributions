Renpy Engine Docset (Archived)
=======================

[Renpy](http://www.renpy.org/) docset for [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash), [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org), etc..

I tried building `8.3.1` on `Ubuntu 24.04 Arm`. This time I noticed some useful print information. In the `Source code(zip)` of releases there will build higher version Renpy. And the documentation is non-release. I didn't realize it before. So I only recommended using [online documents](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/) at present.
