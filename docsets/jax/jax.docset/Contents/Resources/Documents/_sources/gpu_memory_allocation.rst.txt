GPU memory allocation
=====================

**JAX will preallocate 90% of currently-available GPU memory when the first JAX
operation is run.** Preallocating minimizes allocation overhead and memory
fragmentation, but can sometimes cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. If your JAX
process fails with OOM, the following environment variables can be used to
override the default behavior:

``XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false``
  This disables the preallocation behavior.  JAX will instead allocate GPU
  memory as needed, potentially decreasing the overall memory usage.  However,
  this behavior is more prone to GPU memory fragmentation, meaning a JAX program
  that uses most of the available GPU memory may OOM with preallocation
  disabled.

``XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=.XX``
  If preallocation is enabled, this makes JAX preallocate XX% of
  currently-available GPU memory, instead of the default 90%. Lowering the
  amount preallocated can fix OOMs that occur when the JAX program starts.

``XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR=platform``
  This makes JAX allocate exactly what is needed on demand, and deallocate
  memory that is no longer needed (note that this is the only configuration that
  will deallocate GPU memory, instead of reusing it). This is very slow, so is
  not recommended for general use, but may be useful for running with the
  minimal possible GPU memory footprint or debugging OOM failures.


Common causes of OOM failures
-----------------------------

**Running multiple JAX processes concurrently.**
  Either use :code:`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION` to give each process an
  appropriate amount of memory, or set
  :code:`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false`.

**Running JAX and GPU TensorFlow concurrently.**
  TensorFlow also preallocates by default, so this is similar to running
  multiple JAX processes concurrently.

  One solution is to use CPU-only
  TensorFlow (e.g. if you're only doing data loading with TF). You can prevent
  TensorFlow from using the GPU with the command
  :code:`tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices([], "GPU")`

  Alternatively, use :code:`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION` or
  :code:`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE`. There are
  also similar options to configure TensorFlow's GPU memory allocation
  (`gpu_memory_fraction
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/protobuf/config.proto#L36>`_
  and `allow_growth
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/protobuf/config.proto#L40>`_
  in TF1, which should be set in a :code:`tf.ConfigProto` passed to
  :code:`tf.Session`. See
  `Using GPUs: Limiting GPU memory growth
  <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu#limiting_gpu_memory_growth>`_
  for TF2).

**Running JAX on the display GPU.**
  Use :code:`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION` or
  :code:`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE`.
