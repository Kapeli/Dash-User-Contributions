GNU Make docset
===============

This docset is basically a copy of the GNU Make Manual (HTML format). The
script and Makefile (naturally) to generate the docset can be obtained from
<https://github.com/lshprung/gnu-make-dash-docset>.

This is the work of Louie Shprung. Where to find me:

Older versions of this docset were created and maintained by Benjamin Ragheb
