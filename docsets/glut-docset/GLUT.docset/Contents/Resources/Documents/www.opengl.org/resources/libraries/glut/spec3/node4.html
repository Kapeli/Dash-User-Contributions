<P>
GLUT simplifies the implementation of programs using OpenGL rendering.
The GLUT application programming interface (API) requires very few
routines to display a graphics scene rendered using OpenGL.  The GLUT
API (like the OpenGL API) is stateful.  Most initial GLUT state is
defined and the initial state is reasonable for simple programs.
<P>
The GLUT routines also take relatively few parameters.  No pointers are
returned.  The only pointers passed into GLUT are pointers to character
strings (all strings passed to GLUT are copied, not referenced) and
opaque font handles.
<P>
The GLUT API is (as much as reasonable) window system independent.  For
this reason, GLUT does not return <em> any</em> native window system
handles, pointers, or other data structures.  More subtle window system
dependencies such as reliance on window system dependent fonts are
avoided by GLUT; instead, GLUT supplies its own (limited) set of
fonts.
<P>
For programming ease, GLUT provides a simple menu sub-API.  While the
menuing support is designed to be implemented as pop-up menus, GLUT
gives window system leeway to support the menu functionality in
another manner (pull-down menus for example).
<P>
Two of the most important pieces of GLUT state are the <em> current
window</em> and <em> current menu</em>.  Most window and menu routines affect
the <em> current window</em> or <em> menu</em> respectively.  Most callbacks
implicitly set the <em> current window</em> and <em> menu</em> to the
appropriate window or menu responsible for the callback.  GLUT is
designed so that a program with only a single window and/or menu will
not need to keep track of any window or menu identifiers.  This greatly
simplifies very simple GLUT programs.
<P>
GLUT is designed for simple to moderately complex programs focused on
OpenGL rendering.  GLUT implements its own event loop.  For this
reason, mixing GLUT with other APIs that demand their own event
handling structure may be difficult.  The advantage of a builtin event
dispatch loop is simplicity.
<P>
GLUT contains routines for rendering fonts and geometric objects,
however GLUT makes no claims on the OpenGL display list name space.
For this reason, none of the GLUT rendering routines use OpenGL display
lists.  It is up to the GLUT programmer to compile the output from GLUT
rendering routines into display lists if this is desired.
<P>
GLUT routines are logically organized into several sub-APIs according
to their functionality.  The sub-APIs are:
<DL ><DT><em> Initialization.</em>
<DD>
Command line processing,
window system initialization, and initial window creation state are controlled
by these routines.
<DT><em> Beginning Event Processing.</em>
<DD>
This routine enters GLUT's event processing loop.  This routine never returns,
and it continuously calls GLUT callbacks as necessary.
<DT><em> Window Management.</em>
<DD>
These routines create and control windows.
<DT><em> Overlay Management.</em>
<DD>
These routines establish and manage overlays for windows.
<DT><em> Menu Management.</em>
<DD>
These routines create and control pop-up menus.
<DT><em> Callback Registration.</em>
<DD>
These routines register callbacks to be called by the GLUT event processing loop.
<DT><em> Color Index Colormap Management.</em>
<DD>
These routines allow the manipulation of color index colormaps for windows.
<DT><em> State Retrieval.</em>
<DD>
These routines allows programs to retrieve state from GLUT.
<DT><em> Font Rendering.</em>
<DD>
These routines allow rendering of stroke and bitmap fonts.
<DT><em> Geometric Shape Rendering.</em>
<DD>
These routines allow the rendering of 3D geometric objects including spheres,
cones, icosahedrons, and teapots.
