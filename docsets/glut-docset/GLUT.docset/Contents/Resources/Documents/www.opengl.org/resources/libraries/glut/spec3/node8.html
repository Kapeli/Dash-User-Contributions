A number of terms are used in a GLUT-specific manner throughout this
document.  The GLUT meaning of these terms is independent of the
window system GLUT is used with.  Here are GLUT-specific
meanings for the following GLUT-specific terms:
<DL ><DT><em> <A NAME=125>&#160;</A>Callback</em>
<DD>  A programmer specified routine that can be
registered with GLUT to be called in response to a specific type
of event.  Also used to refer to a specific callback routine
being called.
<DT><em> <A NAME=126>&#160;</A>Colormap</em>
<DD>  A mapping of pixel values to RGB color values.
  Use by color index windows.
<DT><em> <A NAME=127>&#160;</A>Dials and button box</em>
<DD>  A sophisticated input device
consisting of a pad of buttons and an array of rotating dials, often
used by computer-aided design programs.
<DT><em> <A NAME=128>&#160;</A>Display mode</em>
<DD>  A set of OpenGL frame buffer capabilities
that can be attributed to a window.
<DT><em> <A NAME=129>&#160;</A>Idle</em>
<DD>  A state when no window system events are received
for processing as callbacks and the idle callback, if one is registered,
is called.
<DT><em> <A NAME=130>&#160;</A>Layer in use</em>
<DD>  Either the normal plane or overlay.  This
per-window state determines what frame buffer layer OpenGL commands affect.
<DT><em> <A NAME=131>&#160;</A>Menu entry</em>
<DD>  A menu item that the user can select to
trigger the menu callback for the menu entry's value.
<DT><em> <A NAME=132>&#160;</A>Menu item</em>
<DD>  Either a menu entry or a sub-menu trigger.
<DT><em> <A NAME=133>&#160;</A>Modifiers</em>
<DD>  The Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys that can be held down
simultaneously with a key or mouse button being pressed or released.
<DT><em> <A NAME=134>&#160;</A>Multisampling</em>
<DD>  A technique for hardware antialiasing
generally available only on expensive 3D graphics hardware [<A HREF="node112.html#akeley93">1</A>].  Each
pixel is composed of a number of samples (each containing color and
depth information).  The samples are averaged to determine the
displayed pixel color value.  Multisampling is supported as an
extension to OpenGL.
<DT><em> <A NAME=136>&#160;</A>Normal plane</em>
<DD>  The default frame buffer layer where GLUT window
state resides; as opposed to the <em> overlay</em>.
<DT><em> <A NAME=138>&#160;</A>Overlay</em>
<DD>  A frame buffer layer that can be displayed preferentially
to the <em> normal plane</em> and supports transparency to display through to the
<em> normal plane</em>.  Overlays are useful for rubber-banding effects, text
annotation, and other operations, to avoid damaging the normal plane frame
buffer state.  Overlays require hardware support not present on all systems.
<DT><em> <A NAME=141>&#160;</A>Pop</em>
<DD>  The act of forcing a window to the top of the
stacking order for sibling windows.
<DT><em> <A NAME=142>&#160;</A>Pop-up menu</em>
<DD>  A menu that can be set to appear when a specified
mouse button is pressed in a window.  A pop-menu consists of multiple
menu items.
<DT><em> <A NAME=143>&#160;</A>Push</em>
<DD>  The act of forcing a window to the bottom of the
stacking order for sibling windows.
<DT><em> <A NAME=144>&#160;</A>Reshape</em>
<DD>  The act of changing the size or shape of the window.
<DT><em> <A NAME=145>&#160;</A>Spaceball</em>
<DD>  A sophisticated 3D input device that provides 
six degrees of freedom, three axes of rotation and three axes of
translation.  It also supports a number
of buttons.  The device is a hand-sized ball attached to a base.  By
cupping the ball with one's hand and applying torsional or directional force
on the ball, rotations and translationsare generated.
<DT><em> <A NAME=146>&#160;</A>Stereo</em>
<DD>  A frame buffer capability providing left
  and right color buffers for creating stereoscopic renderings.  Typically,
  the user wears LCD shuttered goggles synchronized with the alternating
  display on the screen of the left and right color buffers.
<DT><em> <A NAME=147>&#160;</A>Sub-menu</em>
<DD>  A menu cascaded from some sub-menu trigger.
<DT><em> <A NAME=148>&#160;</A>Sub-menu trigger</em>
<DD>  A menu item that the user can enter to
cascade another pop-up menu.
<DT><em> <A NAME=149>&#160;</A>Subwindow</em>
<DD>  A type of window that is the child window of
a top-level window or other subwindow.  The drawing and visible region
of a subwindow is limited by its parent window.
<DT><em> <A NAME=150>&#160;</A>Tablet</em>
<DD>  A precise 2D input device.  Like
a mouse, 2D coordinates are returned.  The absolute position of the
tablet ``puck'' on the tablet is returned.  Tablets also support
a number of buttons.
<DT><em> <A NAME=151>&#160;</A>Timer</em>
<DD>  A callback that can be scheduled to be called in
a specified interval of time.
<DT><em> <A NAME=152>&#160;</A>Top-level window</em>
<DD>  A window that can be placed, moved, resized,
etc. independently from other top-level windows by the user.
Subwindows may reside within a top-level window.
<DT><em> <A NAME=153>&#160;</A>Window</em>
<DD>  A rectangular area for OpenGL rendering.
<DT><em> <A NAME=154>&#160;</A>Window display state</em>
<DD>  One of shown, hidden, or iconified.
A shown window is potentially visible on the screen (it may be obscured
by other windows and not actually visible).  A hidden window will
never be visible.  An iconified window is not visible but could
be made visible in response to some user action like clicking on the
window's corresponding icon.
<DT><em> <A NAME=155>&#160;</A>Window system</em>
<DD>  A broad notion 
that refers to both the mechanism and policy of the window system.
For example, in the X Window System both the window manager and the
X server are integral to what GLUT considers the window system.
