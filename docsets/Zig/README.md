# Zig docset
Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

This docset includes static renditions of
- [The Zig Language Reference](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/).
- [The Zig Standard Library](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/) (beta) for 0.9.1 onwards only.

Note: The standard library reference above is the public output of [autodoc](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/How-to-contribute-to-Autodoc) which is experimental and under heavy development at this time. Expect issues and broken links.
