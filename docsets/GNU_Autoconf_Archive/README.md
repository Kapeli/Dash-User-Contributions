GNU Autoconf Archive Docset
===========================

This docset is basically a copy of the GNU Autoconf Archive Manual (HTML format). The
script and Makefile to generate the docset can be obtained from
<https://github.com/lshprung/gnu-autoconf-archive-dash-docset>.

This is the work of Louie Shprung. Where to find me:
