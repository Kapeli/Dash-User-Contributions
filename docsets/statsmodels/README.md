_statsmodels_ Docset


 - Author: Angelo Varlotta (http://github.com/capac/)
 - Documentation: downloaded from the v0.11.1 folder from the repository at https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels.github.io/.

I just downloaded the v0.11.1 folder, which you can do by using SVN:

```
svn checkout https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels.github.io/trunk/v0.11.1
```

Basically place `trunk` in place of `tree/master` in the URL for the v0.11.1 folder. The docs folder with the HTML files will be present once you run the command above, and there you can run the `doc2dash` command.
