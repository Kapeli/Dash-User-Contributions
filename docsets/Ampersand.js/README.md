## Bugs & Enhancements

If you have problems with this documentation set, or you would like to suggest 
improvements, feel free to report them on the
[Ampersand.js Dash Docset Issue Tracker](https://github.com/remko/ampersandjs-dash-generator/issues).

## Notes

Since Ampersand.js is a collection of independently versioned modules, the docset
consists of a snapshot of the Ampersand.js documentation on a given time, without
a 'specific' version number. If the Ampersand.js project should move to a global
versioning system, I will update the docset to follow this.
