Kirby
======================

A docset for [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) compiled by [Sam Nabi](http://samnabi.com).

To generate the docset, loop through [all the pages in the docs](https://github.com/getkirby/getkirby.com/tree/master/content/1-docs/) and look for pages with a template `cheatsheet.item`. I ran this within a Kirby install, using a custom template to extract the information and export each page as an HTML document. The related SQL query to populate Dash's `searchIndex` is also generated by the script.

Manually move the generated HTML pages to `Kirby.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/`. You should be ready to go.

Refer to the [Dash Docset Generation Guide](https://kapeli.com/docsets) for more details.
