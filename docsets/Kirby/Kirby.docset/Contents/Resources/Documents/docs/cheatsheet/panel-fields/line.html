<html lang="en"><head><title>Line</title></head><body><h1>Line</h1><p>Draws a horizontal line to separate fields</p><p>Sometimes it can be helpful to visually seperate the form into different sections. The line field is perfect here. It will draw a horizontal rule with enough white space around it to separate sets of fields nicely.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code>fields:
  line:
    type: line</code></pre>
<p>If you want to add multiple lines to your form, make sure that the names for each field are unique:</p>
<pre><code>fields:

  …

  line-a:
    type: line

  …

  line-b:
    type: line

  …

  line-c:
    type: line</code></pre></body></html>
