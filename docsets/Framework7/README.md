Framework7 Docset
=================

# Author
I'm Adnan RIHAN, a Web and System developper, mainly for fun but also for work.

You can contact me by email (on my [Github page](https://github.com/Max13)) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Max13).

And finally, you can checkout my GPG keys on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/Max13)

# Prerequisites
- `dashing-0.4` (available on my homebrew tap `max13/dashing`)
- `wget`

# Generate the docset
This is simple as hell...!

The `generate.bash` script will download the HTML docs and related files, AND generate the docset. This is done specially for __you__ !

If you start the generate script multiple times, it will only download newer HTML files.

# Known issues
None for now. But if you need anything, open an issue on my own repo: https://github.com/Max13/dash-carbon
