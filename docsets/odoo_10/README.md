# Odoo v10 Docset

## Author

The Odoo documentation is created by [Odoo
SA](https://www.odoo.com/page/about-us) and the whole Odoo community.

The docset was generated by Albert De La Fuente
([GitHub](https://github.com/vonpupp)).

## Building instructions

A build script, called `build.sh`, is included. It assumes that you
have all packages, required to build Odoo's pip dependencies, installed.

## Credits

Based on Odoo v8 Dash user contributions of Naglis Jonaitis.
