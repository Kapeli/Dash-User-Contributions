Godot Docset
=======================

[Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/) docset for [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash), [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org), etc..

This document is large and updated every week. So I think it's better that only push the major version updates to upstream at present. In zeal, you can use these feed urls:

- Godot 4: `http://zealusercontributions.vercel.app/api/docsets/Godot.xml`
- Godot 3: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/scillidan/bd79941c314384f408984f4f0664c7fe/raw/44e6a10ca8b41221fafb520df8272e53fcafbbc2/Godot3.xml`

If you really want latest version, I suggest:

- Using [online document](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/).
- Downloading files from [releases](https://github.com/scillidan/share_godot-docs/releases).
- In zeal, use these:
	- Godot 4: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scillidan/share_godot-docs/refs/heads/main/Godot.xml`
	- Godot 3: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scillidan/share_godot-docs/refs/heads/main/Godot3.xml`
