ICU
=======================

Uploader: Erick Guan ([@fantasticfears](https://github.com/fantasticfears))

Instruction:

* Download source package from http://site.icu-project.org/download/59#TOC-ICU4C-Download.
* run `./configure` and `make doc`
* Edit `Doxyfile` as the instruction from Dash.

Related:

* The docset includes C/C++ ICU API. Nothing for ICU4j. I guess it's possible to get from Maven or anywhere else.
