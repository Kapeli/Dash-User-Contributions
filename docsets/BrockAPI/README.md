##This docset is exclusively for the BrockAPI. I own no licenses to re-distribute the BrockAPI. 

###This is simply an easier way to access the BrockAPI for students at Brock University. For any concerns feel free to contact me, any copyright requests (Which I doubt there will be any) will be complied with. The initial documentation for this can be found at: cosc.brocku.ca : where it will be infrequently updated. This will not frequently be updated, however when there are updates it will be on the same schedule as the official BrockAPI found at: cosc.brocku.ca : It is relevant to mention that this library shouldn't be used for non-academic purposes, and that this redistributon is simply as a tool to better access the API for Brock Students.
