Logstash documentation
======================

The docset can be generated using my repository:
https://github.com/WoLpH/dash-docset-logstash

After that make sure you have the following requirements:

 1. `gnu-sed` (With homebrew you can install this using `brew install gnu-sed`)
 2. `git`
 3. `sqlite3`

And run the `generate.sh` command:

  ./generate.sh

Please let me know if you have any issues:
