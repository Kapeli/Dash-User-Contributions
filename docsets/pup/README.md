pup Docset
=======================

Made by [Pysis](https://github.com/Pysis868)

Taken from https://github.com/ericchiang/pup.

Accessed GitHub interface and took html from content pane.

Notes:

Tried removing any HTML that:
 - comes from my browser extensions.
 - accesses unecessary remote resources.
 - includes any private or meaningless data.

Kept relevant / project specific metadata.
Kept/Added referenced stylesheet files and changed links for those.
Added indicies corresponding to the two topmost header levels.

Could not pretty print / format README HTML without destroying I think the preformatted blocks, section links become prefixed a weird colored underline, and maybe other errors as well, so the body looks like a mess in the source, but the visual display is nice and succint.
