<p>If you are new to Splunk Enterprise, read the <i>Splunk Enterprise Overview.</i> If you are familiar with Splunk Enterprise and want to explore the new features interactively, download the Splunk Enterprise 6.2 Overview app.
</p><p>For system requirements information, see the <i>Installation Manual</i>.
</p><p>Before proceeding, review the <a href="#knownissues" class="external text">Known Issues for this release</a>.
</p><p>Splunk Enterprise 6.2 was first released to customers on October 28, 2014.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_planning_to_upgrade_from_an_earlier_version.3f"><span class="mw-headline" id="Planning_to_upgrade_from_an_earlier_version.3F">Planning to upgrade from an earlier version?</span></a></h3>
<p>If you plan to upgrade from an earlier version of Splunk Enterprise to version 6.2, read "How to upgrade Splunk Enterprise" in the Installation Manual for important information you need to know before you upgrade.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_search_head_clustering"><span class="mw-headline" id="Search_head_clustering">Search head clustering</span></a></h3>
<p>Search head clusters are groups of Splunk Enterprise search heads that serve as a central resource for searching. You can run or access the same searches, dashboards, knowledge objects, and so on, from any member of the cluster.  This feature is designed to provide horizontal scaling, high availability, and no single point of failure.  
</p><p>For more information, see "About search head clustering" in the <i>Distributed Search</i> manual.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_indexer_cluster_monitoring"><span class="mw-headline" id="Indexer_cluster_monitoring">Indexer cluster monitoring</span></a></h3>
<p>A new dashboard provides detailed information on the status of the entire cluster, as well as information on each of the cluster master's peer nodes.
</p><p>For more information, see "View the indexer cluster master dashboard" in the <i>Managing Indexers and Clusters of Indexers </i> manual.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_distributed_management_console"><span class="mw-headline" id="Distributed_management_console">Distributed management console</span></a></h3>
<p>The distributed management console provides insight into your Splunk Enterprise deployment with information on instances, indexing performance, search activity, resource usage, license usage, and more. 
</p><p>For more information, see "Configure the distributed management console" in the <i>Admin Manual</i>.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_getting_data_in"><span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_data_in">Getting data in</span></a></h3>
<p>This release features completely remodeled pages and wizard-like workflows for adding data. The new Data Preview feature makes it easier to create the right sourcetype for your data, and the new Forwarder Inputs feature allows you to push input configurations to Splunk Enterprise deployment clients.
</p><p>For more information, see "How do you want to add data?" in the <i>Getting Data In</i> manual.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_advanced_field_extractor"><span class="mw-headline" id="Advanced_field_extractor">Advanced field extractor</span></a></h3>
<p>The advanced field extractor allows you to create custom fields in Splunk Enterprise. This feature allows you to select fields in events and automatically generate a regular expression that captures the fields. 
</p><p>For more information, see "Build field extractions with the Field Extractor" in the <i>Knowledge Manager Manual</i>.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_app_key_value_store"><span class="mw-headline" id="App_key_value_store">App key value store</span></a></h3>
<p>The app key value store enables developers to build rich applications by providing a way to store and retrieve data for use in the operation of an app, such as state data. The app key value store provides both a REST API for full read/write operations and direct access to data via the Splunk Enterprise search pipeline.
</p><p>For more information, see "About KV store" in the <i>Admin Manual</i>.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_event_pattern_detection"><span class="mw-headline" id="Event_pattern_detection">Event pattern detection</span></a></h3>
<p>Splunk Enterprise 6.2 can analyze your data for patterns of common events. Run a search and click on the Patterns tab to review a list of the top event patterns in the search dataset. You can see the estimated number of events associated with each pattern and run a new search that returns events matching a selected pattern. You can save patterns as event types and alerts.
</p><p>For more information, see "Identify event patterns with the Patterns tab" in the <i>Search Manual</i>.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_instant_pivot"><span class="mw-headline" id="Instant_pivot">Instant pivot</span></a></h3>
<p>In past releases, to create tables and charts based on search results, you needed to run a search that included transforming commands like <code><font size="2">stats</font></code> or <code><font size="2">timechart</font></code>. With instant pivot, you can now run a non-transforming search and then open the search in Pivot. From there, you can create tables and charts that reflect the data returned by the search. When you are finished you can save your Pivot creations as reports or dashboard panels.
</p><p>For more information, see "Open a non-transforming search in Pivot to create tables and charts" in the <i>Search Manual</i>.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_home_page_redesign"><span class="mw-headline" id="Home_page_redesign">Home page redesign</span></a></h3>
<p>Splunk Enterprise 6.2 introduces a redesigned home page. The new design moves Apps into a scrollable list on the left side of the page and creates space for a user-specific dashboard in the center of the page. A collapsible panel at the top of the page provides helpful links for getting started with Splunk Enterprise.
</p><p>For more information, see "Meet Splunk Web" in the <i>Admin Manual</i>.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_prebuilt_panels"><span class="mw-headline" id="Prebuilt_panels">Prebuilt panels</span></a></h3>
<p>You can now create customized panels to share among various dashboards. This is useful to create a personalized dashboard for a group of users. It is also useful to make a commonly used search and visualization readily available to other dashboards.
</p><p>You can share a prebuilt panel from the same app, a different app, or from a different user.
</p><p>For more information, in the <i>Dashboards and Visualizations</i> manual see:
</p>
<ul><li>Dashboard panel
</li><li>Create and add a panel by reference
</li></ul><h3> <a name="meetsplunk_post-process_searches"><span class="mw-headline" id="Post-process_searches">Post-process searches</span></a></h3>
<p>If your dashboard contains panels that run similar searches, you can save search resources by creating a base search for the dashboard. Panels in the dashboard can use a post-process search to further modify the results of a base search. The base search can be a global search for the dashboard or any other search within the dashboard.
</p><p>For more information, see "Post-process searches" in the <i>Dashboards and Visualizations</i> manual.
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_new_search_commands"><span class="mw-headline" id="New_search_commands">New search commands</span></a></h3>
<p>This release includes the new search command, findkeywords. You can use this command after the <code><font size="2">cluster</font></code> command, or a similar command that groups events. 
</p>
<h3> <a name="meetsplunk_new_rest_apis"><span class="mw-headline" id="New_REST_APIs">New REST APIs</span></a></h3>
<p>This release includes the following updates to the REST API.

<p>Splunk requires ample disk I/O bandwidth to perform indexing tasks. In particular, disk write operations are very intensive. These disk writes can clash with any product - such as anti-virus on-access scan software - that installs a driver that intermediates between Splunk and the operating system.
</p><p>When you run Splunk (Enterprise or forwarder) on a Windows computer that has an anti-virus product such as McAfee's VirusScan installed, Splunk strongly recommends that you exclude all Splunk processes as well as the Splunk installation directory from any kind of on-access scanning.
</p><p>Failure to exclude the Splunk processes and installation directory from these scans can lead to poor performance, including but not limited to an unresponsive machine.

<p>This page discusses how to work around an issue where network-intensive Splunk Enterprise operations on a Windows system can sometimes cause that system to become inaccessible from the network.
</p>
<h3> <a name="workaroundfornetworkaccessibilityissuesonsplunkwindowssystems_symptoms"><span class="mw-headline" id="Symptoms">Symptoms</span></a></h3>
<p>A Windows system that supports a Splunk Enterprise instance which performs network-intensive operations can become inaccessible from the network after a period of time. Problems usually begin within eight to twelve hours, but can start as late as 2-3 days depending on the amount of network activity that the instance sees. When this anomaly occurs, any attempts to connect to the system remotely fail, and you must restart the computer to return it to service.
</p><p>You might see the following error in splunkd.log, or in the search.log file(s) created in the individual dispatch directory that each search (scheduled or real-time) generates:
</p>
<div class="samplecode">
<code><font size="2"><br>01-16-2013 06:55:33.935 WARN &nbsp;NetUtils - Error connecting - winsock error 10055\n<br></font></code>
</div> 
<h3> <a name="workaroundfornetworkaccessibilityissuesonsplunkwindowssystems_cause"><span class="mw-headline" id="Cause">Cause</span></a></h3>
<p>This problem has multiple causes:
</p>
<ul><li> By default, Windows configures a low number (5000) of available ephemeral, or short-lived, network (TCP) ports.
</li><li> When you perform network-intensive activities in Splunk Enterprise, Splunk generates a large number of short-lived network connections, which use these ports. Network-intensive activities include but are not limited to:
<ul><li> Running a large number of concurrent real-time searches (usually from an app).
</li><li> Configuring a deployment client to connect to a deployment server which is on the same computer. 
</li></ul></li><li> Once the Windows system runs out of available ports, it returns <code><font size="2">WSAENOBUFS</font></code> (Windows Sockets error 10055) to any application that requests a port for network operations, and immediately becomes inaccessible from the network.
</li></ul><p>When this happens, the only way to fix the problem is to reboot the affected computer.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> While this problem most commonly occurs when you employ numerous concurrent real-time searches, any kind of search - and more importantly, any kind of network operation - can trigger the issue. The problem is not limited to Splunk, but Splunk can often cause the problem to appear. 
</p><p>This problem only appears on Windows systems.
</p>
<h3> <a name="workaroundfornetworkaccessibilityissuesonsplunkwindowssystems_workaround"><span class="mw-headline" id="Workaround">Workaround</span></a></h3>
<p>To work around this issue, you can complete one or both of the following steps.
</p><p><b>Caution:</b> The steps below require that you make administrative changes to your Windows system. These advanced changes might render your system unstable or unusable. If you are not able to make these changes, or are either unsure or uncomfortable about what to do, then contact your internal IT support organization for assistance.
</p><p><b>1. Modify the Registry to increase the number of available user ports.</b> Follow the instructions at "When you try to connect from TCP ports greater than 5000 you receive the error 'WSAENOBUFS'" (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/196271/en-us) on the Microsoft Support site to modify the Registry and increase the number of ephemeral TCP ports. 
</p><p><b>Important:</b> We suggest you complete this step first, then restart your system. If the problem persists, then perform the next step.
</p><p><b>2. Install a downloadable hotfix from Microsoft.</b> If your system is a multiple-CPU system that runs either Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7, then you can download and install a hotfix which addresses this specific issue. For information and instructions on how to download and apply the hotfix, see "Kernel sockets leak on a multiprocessor computer that is running Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7" (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2577795) on the Microsoft Support site.
</p><p><b>Important:</b> This option is available only for systems with multiple CPUs that run Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7.
</p><p>You must restart your computer after performing either of these actions.

<p>This page discusses how to work around an issue where installing or upgrading the Splunk 6.0 universal forwarder on Windows systems enables the Registry monitor and file system change (FSchange) inputs unexpectedly under certain conditions.
</p>
<h3> <a name="workaroundforwindowsuniversalforwarderenablinginputsunexpectedly_symptoms"><span class="mw-headline" id="Symptoms">Symptoms</span></a></h3>
<p>When you install or upgrade the Splunk version 6.0 universal forwarder under certain conditions as detailed below, the universal forwarder enables monitoring of the Registry and changes to the file system.
</p><p>Soon after installing the universal forwarder, you might see license violations on your Splunk indexers due to the significant increase in indexing volume that the enabled inputs generate.
</p>
<h3> <a name="workaroundforwindowsuniversalforwarderenablinginputsunexpectedly_cause"><span class="mw-headline" id="Cause">Cause</span></a></h3>
<p>This problem has multiple causes:
</p>
<ul><li>  The Splunk Technology Add-on for Windows (which is included in the Splunk universal forwarder installation package) has a configuration file, <code><font size="2">regmon-filters.conf</font></code>, which enables Registry monitoring by default. 
</li><li> The TA also has an <code><font size="2">inputs.conf</font></code> which enables the fschange input by default.
</li><li> Migration logic introduced in version 5.0 of Splunk now moves configuration information from files like <code><font size="2">regmon-filters.conf</font></code> to <code><font size="2">inputs.conf</font></code>. This causes specific problems in this scenario when you upgrade the universal forwarder.
</li></ul><p>This problem only appears on Windows systems.

<p>Some distributions of Linux (for example, Red Hat/CentOS and Ubuntu) have an advanced memory management scheme called <b>Transparent Huge Pages</b> (THP). THP allows the system to automatically take advantage of huge memory pages without specific action on the behalf of the administrator or the running software.  Every CPU in a modern server system has an MMU which manages memory in pages, and huge pages are structures that allow MMUs to provide access to multiple gigabytes and terabytes of memory more efficiently.
</p><p>THP has been associated with degradation of Splunk Enterprise performance in at least some Linux kernel versions (for example, the 2.6.32 kernel used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6). When enabled, THP can significantly degrade overall system performance on systems that run Splunk Enterprise because of several issues: 
</p>
<ul><li> The implementation is too aggressive at coalescing memory pages for short-lived processes (such as many Splunk searches)
</li><li> It can prevent the <code><font size="2">jemalloc</font></code> memory allocation implementation from releasing memory back to the operating system.
</li><li> For some workloads, it can cause I/O regressions surrounding swapping of huge pages.  
</li></ul><p>On systems with THP enabled, we have observed a minimum of a 30% reduction in indexing and search performance, with a similar percentage increase in latency. For this reason we recommend that you disable THP in your Linux system configuration unless that system runs an application that requires THP.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> In future versions of Linux, kernel engineers might find ways to improve the behavior of THP for the Splunk workload.
</p><p>See the following pages for additional information about THP and how to disable it:

<p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
</p><p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.
</p><p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.
</p><p>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

</p><p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
</p><p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
</p><p>1. Definitions
</p><p>"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
"Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
</p><p>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
</p><p>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
For the avoidance of doubt:
</p><p>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
</p><p>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
</p><p>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
</p><p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</p><p>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p><p>7. Termination
</p><p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
</p><p>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

<p>Version 0.7.0
</p><p>Httplib2
</p>
<hr><p>Introduction
</p><p>A comprehensive HTTP client library, httplib2.py supports many 
features left out of other HTTP libraries.
</p><p>HTTP and HTTPS
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;HTTPS support is only available if the socket module was <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compiled with SSL support. <br></font></code>
<p>Keep-Alive
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Supports HTTP 1.1 Keep-Alive, keeping the socket open and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performing multiple requests over the same connection if <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible. <br></font></code>
<p>Authentication
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;The following three types of HTTP Authentication are <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supported. These can be used over both HTTP and HTTPS.<br></font></code>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Digest<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Basic<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* WSSE<br></font></code>
<p>Caching
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;The module can optionally operate with a private cache that <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understands the Cache-Control: header and uses both the ETag <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Last-Modified cache validators. <br></font></code>
<p>All Methods
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;The module can handle any HTTP request method, not just GET <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and POST.<br></font></code>
<p>Redirects
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Automatically follows 3XX redirects on GETs.<br></font></code>
<p>Compression
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Handles both 'deflate' and 'gzip' types of compression.<br></font></code>
<p>Lost update support
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Automatically adds back ETags into PUT requests to resources <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have already cached. This implements Section 3.2 of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detecting the Lost Update Problem Using Unreserved Checkout.<br></font></code>
<p>Unit Tested
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;A large and growing set of unit tests. <br></font></code>
<p><br>
For more information on this module, see:
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/<br></font></code>
<p><br></p>
<hr><p>Installation
</p><p>The httplib2 module is shipped as a distutils package.  To install
the library, unpack the distribution archive, and issue the following
command:
</p>
<code><font size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;$ python setup.py install<br></font></code>
<p><br></p>
<hr><p>Usage
A simple retrieval:
</p>
<code><font size="2"> import httplib2<br>&nbsp;h = httplib2.Http(".cache")<br>&nbsp;(resp_headers, content) = h.request("http://example.org/", "GET")<br></font></code>
<p>The 'content' is the content retrieved from the URL. The content 
is already decompressed or unzipped if necessary.
</p><p>To PUT some content to a server that uses SSL and Basic authentication:
</p>
<code><font size="2"> import httplib2<br>&nbsp;h = httplib2.Http(".cache")<br>&nbsp;h.add_credentials('name', 'password')<br>&nbsp;(resp, content) = h.request("https://example.org/chapter/2", <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PUT", body="This is text", <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;headers={'content-type':'text/plain'} )<br></font></code>
<p>Use the Cache-Control: header to control how the caching operates.
</p>
<code><font size="2"> import httplib2<br>&nbsp;h = httplib2.Http(".cache")<br>&nbsp;(resp, content) = h.request("http://bitworking.org/", "GET")<br>&nbsp;...<br>&nbsp;(resp, content) = h.request("http://bitworking.org/", "GET", <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;headers={'cache-control':'no-cache'})<br></font></code>
<p>The first request will be cached and since this is a request 
to bitworking.org it will be set to be cached for two hours, 
because that is how I have my server configured. Any subsequent 
GET to that URI will return the value from the on-disk cache 
and no request will be made to the server. You can use the 
Cache-Control: header to change the caches behavior and in 
this example the second request adds the Cache-Control: 
header with a value of 'no-cache' which tells the library 
that the cached copy must not be used when handling this request.

You are solely responsible for determining the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br></font></code>
<p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

<hr><p>PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
</p><p>Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.
</p><p>The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

<p>Version 2.1, February 1999
</p><p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
</p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</p><p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]
</p><p>Preamble
</p><p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.
</p><p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
</p><p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
</p><p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
</p><p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
</p><p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
</p><p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
</p><p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
</p><p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
</p><p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
</p><p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p><p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.
</p><p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
</p><p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
</p><p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
</p><p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.
</p><p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
</p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
</p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
</p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</p><p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
</p><p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
</p><p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
</p><p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p><p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</p><p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
</p><p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
</p><p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
</p><p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
</p><p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)
</p><p>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
</p><p>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.
</p><p>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.
</p><p>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
</p><p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
</p><p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
</p><p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.
</p><p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</p><p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
</p><p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
</p><p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
</p><p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
</p><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p><p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</p><p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
</p><p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
</p><p>NO WARRANTY
</p><p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p><p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
</p><p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p><p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
</p><p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).
</p><p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.
</p><p>&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
does.&gt;
</p><p>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
</p><p>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.
</p><p>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307  USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
</p><p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
</p><p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.
</p><p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.
</p><p>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

</p><p>(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
</p><p>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
</p><p>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

</p><p>(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
</p><p>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

<p>Version 2.6
</p>
<h3> <a name="reportlab_licensing"><span class="mw-headline" id="Licensing"> Licensing </span></a></h3>
<p>The ReportLab toolkit and most of our other Open Source tools are available under the BSD license. This means that you can basically do anything you want with it, including using it in a commercial package. (We used to use the Python license, but the Python license became historically complicated. We chose the BSD license because it was the shortest and most readable Open Source license).
</p><p>pyRXP, our XML parser, is under the GNU General Public License. This is because the RXP parser underneath it is under this license. If you want to use pyRXP in a closed source project, you have to negotiate with us.
</p>
<h4><font size="3"><b><i> <a name="reportlab_licensing_for_contributions"><span class="mw-headline" id="Licensing_for_contributions"> Licensing for contributions </span></a></i></b></font></h4>
<p>What is the deal with copyright/licensing of things contributed to reportlab? In particular, for something to eventually make its way into the core reportlab libraries, does one need to assign copyright over to ReportLab Inc, or simply release it under the same style of license as reportlab?
</p><p>The open source is under a BSD compatible license. Anything contributed presumably would be better under that. We're fairly sure that other open source licenses would be acceptable provided they don't effect the toolkit itself.
