[Jenkins Job Builder][1] Docset
===============================

This is the docset for Jenkins Job Builder (JJB).

From the projects description:

Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML format,
and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions in
human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and
auditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating many
similarly configured jobs is easy.
