Zsh Docset
==========

This docset is maintained by [Zhiming Wang](https://github.com/zmwangx).

Build instructions
------------------

To generate the docset, download the generation script
from <https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/9d5d18927e6d1dbccfac970567c59b53>,
and run

    ./gen-zsh-docset <zsh_version_number>

The script handles the rest, including downloads, and spits out a docset as
well as its tarball.
