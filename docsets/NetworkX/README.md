Sample Docset
=======================

When you contribute a docset, you need to edit this README to include the following:
* Who are you (GitHub and/or Twitter username)
* Complete instructions on how to generate the docset, including:
  * List of any prerequisites (especially your docset generation script!)
  * Where or how to download the initial HTML documentation for the docset
  * How to run the generation script
  * Any other notes that might be useful
* List of any known bugs (links to GitHub issues)
* Anything else you think is relevant
