# Dash Docset for the Swift 5.1 Language Guide

## Notes

- Docset contents are from the official Swift [book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html).
- The generation script can be found [here](https://github.com/roeybiran/dash-swift/blob/master/generation_script.sh). To use it, put it in the same folder as the `.docset` file, only after obtaining the source HTML, and execute.

## TODO

- Table of contents.
