## Building the Docset

Here is how I built the docset.

* I downloaded the jar file on [nightly/soot/lib](https://ssebuild.cased.de/nightly/soot/lib/)

* I used `./javadocset <any docset name you want> <path to Javadoc-generated API folder>` to generated the docset file

* I followed the [instructions](http://kapeli.com/docsets) on Kapeli website to add the icon and set the version
