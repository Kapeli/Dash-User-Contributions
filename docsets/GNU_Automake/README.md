GNU Automake Docset
===================

This docset is basically a copy of the GNU Automake Manual (HTML format). The
script and Makefile to generate the docset can be obtained from
<https://github.com/lshprung/gnu-automake-dash-docset>.

This is the work of Louie Shprung. Where to find me:

- GitHub <https://github.com/lshprung>

Most of the work for generating and creating this docset was based on Benjamin Ragheb's GNU Make docset contribution
