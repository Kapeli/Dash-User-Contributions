A line is drawn from the starting point to the next vertex, whichis the next line in the list. If two successive lines are identical, adot is drawn at the specified point.</p><p>A blank line in the points indicates that the previous and next vertexesare not connected by a line--that is, the line, curve, or polygon isbroken into two (or more) pieces. If the last line of the points of apolygon is blank, the polygon is not closed. A closed polygon&#39;s startpoint (the first line of its points property) is the same as its endpoint (the last line of its points property).</p><p>*Tip:*  When setting the points property, you can separate theindividual points with a comma instead of a return. The pointsproperty is always reported with the points on separate lines,however. </p><p>If the style property of the graphic is not &quot;line&quot;, &quot;polygon&quot; or&quot;curve&quot;, the setting of its points property has no effect.</p><p>*Note:*  The rectangle of a graphic is drawn around all its pointswithout touching them. (Usually, this makes no difference, but in somecircumstances where you need to place a graphic&#39;s vertex preciselywith respect to another object&#39;s rectangle, you may need to take thisinto account.)</p></td></tr><tr><td><b>Tags</b></td><td>ui</td></tr></table></body></html>
