The development environment contains allthe features you need to quickly create a professional application. TheApplication Browser allows you to find your way around your applicationas you develop it. The Properties Inspector allows you to set appearanceand basic behaviors. The Script Editor allows you to add code to eachobject in your application. In addition to these standard tools, theMessage Box provides a mini command-line that allows you to developaspects of your application automatically or to test out yourapplication’s code and functionality.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/The Menu Bar" class="dashAnchor"></a>The Menu Bar</h2><h3>The File Menu</h3><p>The File menu contains commands to open, close and save files; print;and incorporate files into your stack.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Menu Item</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>New Stack</strong></td><td>Opens a cascading menu you can use to choose a stack type to create.

Abreakpoint specifies a point at which script execution should pause andthe debugger be loaded. For more details, see the section on Debugging.</p><h3>Apply Button</h3><p>Compiles the script instantly. Any syntax errors will appear in theError Display and the script will not compile. A compiled script is notsaved until the stack that contains it is saved.</p><p>Press <em>Enter</em> (on the numeric keypad) to activate the Compile button.Press <em>Enter</em> again to close the Script Editor.</p><p>Note that <em>none</em> of the message handlers within the script will beavailable if there is a Script Error during compilation, as none of thescript will have compiled.</p><h3>Errors Pane</h3><p>Compile and execution errors will appear here. Double click the iconnext to the error details to highlight the line the error occurred on inthe script (if applicable).</p><p><img src="images/image40.png" alt=""/></p><h3>Handler List</h3><p>The handler list displays all the functions, commands and handlers whichare part of the current script. When a handler name is clicked, thescript will jump to that handler.</p><p>The currently displayed list of handlers can be filtered by typing in the filter box below it.</p><h3>Documentation Pane</h3><p>The Script Editor also has a built-in syntax dictionary. When this tab is active a summary of the dictionary entry for the keyword which you are currently typing will be displayed. The full dictionary entry can beviewed by clicking Launch Documentation. Alternatively you can choose toview the entire entry in place by toggling the Full Document check boxat the bottom of the documentation pane.</p><p><img src="images/image41.png" alt=""/></p><h3>Search Results Pane</h3><p>When you perform a &#39;find all&#39; operation the results will be displayed under this tab.</p><p><img src="images/image42.png" alt=""/></p><h3>Script Tabs</h3><p>When multiple scripts are open they will appear as tabs in the ScriptEditor. Right clicking on the tabs brings up a menu which allows a tabto be moved to a new window, closed, or kept while closing all othertabs. Clicking a tab will bring up the script it represents.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/The Debugger" class="dashAnchor"></a>The Debugger</h2><p>The Debugger helps you track bugs and understand code, by allowing youto pause the execution of your programs or step through them line byline. You cause execution to pause by setting breakpoints. When you runyour script, execution will pause at a breakpoint and you will be ableto observe or edit variable values, continue execution or set anotherbreakpoint later in the code. Each debugger feature is outlined below:</p><p><img src="images/image43.png" alt=""/></p><h3>Continue</h3><p>When in debug mode, the Continue button will start running the code fromthe current position. The program will run until the end is reached oranother breakpoint is found.</p><p>When you are not in debug mode, the continue button can be used toexecute a handler. When you press it, a dialog will appear asking whichhandler you would like to call and, if applicable, which parametersyou&#39;d like to pass. On clicking OK the Script Editor will call the handleryou specified. It will also remember the handler for next time. Tochange the handler called later, choose Entry Point… from the Debug menu.</p><h3>Stop Debugging</h3><p>Will halt execution at the current point and stop debugging. You willthen be able to edit the script.</p><h3>Show Next Statement</h3><p>The Show Next statement option will return the debugger to the currentlyexecuting statement. This is useful if you have switched tabs orscrolled during debugging.</p><h3>Step Into Next Statement</h3><p>Use Step Into to execute the next statement. If the next statement is acommand or function ‘Step Into’ will jump to that function or commandallowing you to execute it line by line.</p><p><img src="images/image44.png" alt=""/></p><h3>Step Over Next Statement</h3><p>Use Step Over to execute a command or function call without steppingthrough it line by line. The code within the handler will run at fullspeed and execution will pause on the line after the handler call.</p><p><img src="images/image45.png" alt=""/></p><h3>Step Out</h3><p>The Step Out function allows you to exit a command or function that youhave previously ‘stepped into’. When selected, the rest of the currenthandler will run and execution will pause on the line after the handlercall. This is useful to avoid stepping through a long command orfunction line by line when you have identified that the error you arelooking for is not within that command or function.</p><p><img src="images/image46.png" alt=""/></p><h3>Debug Context</h3><p>The Debug Context shows you the path of execution up to the currentstatement you are paused on in the debugger. This allows you to identifywhere you are in your program and which handlers called the currenthandler you are in. Changing the debug context allows you to viewvariables from different parts of the program. Use this feature to findan erroneous command call or a call where wrong parameters were used.</p><h3>Variable Watcher</h3><p>The Variable Watcher tab allows you to examine the value of variableswithin your program while it is executing. As you step through your codethese values will be updated. The variable name is shown in the leftcolumn and its value adjacent on the right. If a variable&#39;s value is toolarge to be displayed in the pane it will have a magnifying glass nextto it. Clicking this will bring up a watch window which allows thevariable&#39;s value to be changed. Variables can also be edited by doubleclicking on their value in the variable watcher.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can see the value of a variable by moving the mouse overthe variables’ name in the script field while debugging.</p></blockquote><h3>Breakpoint Management</h3><p>Use breakpoints to specify where to pause execution in the debugger. Youset breakpoints by clicking in the gutter, or by right clicking in theBreakpoint Manager at the bottom of the Script Editor and selecting “NewBreakpoint”. Each breakpoint is associated with a line of code andexecution is paused when that line is reached. Alternatively, acondition can be assigned to the breakpoint. In this case, executionwill only pause if the condition is true when the line is reached.</p><p><img src="images/image47.png" alt=""/></p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To see a list of all the breakpoints within a stack,including the script they are in, which line they are on, and whetherthere is a condition attached, click the Breakpoints Manager at thebottom of the Script Editor. The check box to the left of eachbreakpoint can be used to enable or disable the breakpoint. Doubleclick a breakpoint to go to that line in the associated object&#39;sscript. To edit a breakpoint, including adding a condition or changingthe line number, click the pencil icon. This can also be done byright-clicking on the breakpoint, either in the Breakpoints Manager,or the Script Editor&#39;s gutter.</p></blockquote><p><img src="images/image48.png" alt=""/><img src="images/image49.png" alt=""/></p><p>The Breakpoint Manager also allows you to set watches. These areassociated with variables rather than lines of code and will pauseexecution when the value of the variable you are watching changes.Alternatively, if the watch has a condition attached, execution willonly pause if, when the variable&#39;s value is changed, the condition istrue. To add a watch, right click in the Breakpoint Manager and choose“New Breakpoint”.</p><p><img src="images/image50.png" alt=""/></p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/The Script Editor Menubar" class="dashAnchor"></a>The Script Editor Menubar</h2><p>The Script Editor menubar contains commands to help you edit scripts.</p><h3>The File Menu</h3><p>The File menu contains commands to print a script or close the ScriptEditor, with or without saving changes to the script.</p><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Compile</strong></td><td>Compiles the current script.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Save</strong></td><td>Saves the current stack.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Close</strong></td><td>Closes the current script.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Print</strong></td><td>Prints the current script.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quit</strong></td><td>Exits LiveCode.

Use the following keys to navigate thecompletion list:</p><ul><li>right arrow - apply the completion or enter group of completions</li><li>left arrow - leave group of completions</li><li>up arrow - move up the list</li><li>down arrow - move down the list</li></ul><p>Moving the mouse will hide the completion list to avoid it remaining inplace over an area you would like to select. Completions includeplaceholder fields which you can navigate with the tab key. Somecompletions may have multiple placeholders with the same name whichwill be edited together. Clicking within a placeholder will select it.</p><h4>Autocomplete Pro</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Autocomplete Pro is available in LiveCode Indy and above</p></blockquote><p>Autocomplete Pro provides the following additional features:</p><ul><li>Completions generated dynamically by introspectingthe object being edited and its message path</li><li>An Autocomplete Snippet Manager dialog is accessible from the scripteditor menubar to manage a custom set of completions.</li></ul><h4>Autocomplete Snippet Manager</h4><p>An autocomplete snippet provides the information required to match andcomplete some code in the script editor. The Autocomplete Snippet Managerallows the user to manage a custom set of completion snippets.</p><p>Create a new completion snippet by clicking the <strong>+</strong> icon and delete thecurrently selected snippet by clicking the <strong>-</strong> icon.</p><p>The dialog allows entry of the following:</p><p><strong>Display Name</strong> - choose a completion snippet to edit or change thedisplay name of the current snippet.</p><p><strong>Priority</strong> - A value between 1 and 100 indicating the order thecompletions should be matched in. Higher priorities will be listedbefore lower priorities.</p><p><strong>Match Scope</strong> - Choose whether the completion should try and match whenthe selection is outside a handler, inside a handler or anywhere. Acomment completion might be anywhere, a statement completion (unlesslocal, global or constant) would be only inside a handler and a handlercompletion would be outside a handler.</p><p><strong>Match Words</strong> - Choose whether to match only all the words of a line,just the word being written or either. A statement would be all the wordson a line, an expression would be just the current word and a commentwould be either.</p><p><strong>Alternate Match String</strong> - When matching completion snippets the textof the completion is matched first but in some cases that is not suitableor another string would be better to match. Enter a string to try matchingif the completion fails to match.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong> - This field is optional and provides some detail below thecompletion in the script editor.</p><p><strong>Completion</strong> - This is the string to be used when replacing theselection after choosing a completion. The completion may be any scriptand any length. Add placeholders to the completion in the following form:</p><pre><code>${&lt;name&gt;:&lt;type&gt;}</code></pre><p>Where:</p><ul><li>name - is the text seen in the script editor</li><li><p>type - is used to filter the completions presented for the placeholderone of:</p><ul><li>statement - any LiveCode command</li><li>expression - any LiveCode expression</li><li>identifier - a variable or handler name</li></ul></li></ul><p>Additionally, it is possible to include multiple placeholders with thesame name. When a multiple placeholder is selected they are editedat the same time. In this example completion as the user enters thecondition a comment is appended to the <code>end if</code> with the condition text.Once the condition is complete the user may tab to the <code>-- code</code> lineand enter a statement. The tab order is always top to bottom and left toright:</p><pre><code>if ${condition:expression} then    ${-- code:statement}end if # ${condition}</code></pre><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/The Message Box" class="dashAnchor"></a>The Message Box</h2><p>The Message Box is a command line tool that allows you to run scripts orperform automated editing operations.

TheShow LiveCode UI Scripts is an advanced option that displays all of thelibraries used by the LiveCode IDE. This is discussed in the section on<em>Editing the LiveCode User Interface</em>.</p><h3>Stacks In Use</h3><p>This mode is the same as the Front and Back scripts mode, except that itdisplays the <strong>stacksInUse</strong> global property. You can also add a stackdirectly using the Add button.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/The Toolbar" class="dashAnchor"></a>The Toolbar</h2><p>The main toolbar provides easy access to commonly used functions.</p><p><img src="images/image52.png" alt=""/></p><p>Figure 11 – The Main Toolbar</p><p>For details on what each toolbar icon does, see the section on the MenuBar (above).</p><p>To hide and show the text or icons on the tool bar, use <strong>View -&gt; Toolbar Text</strong> and <strong>View -&gt; Toolbar Icons</strong>. To hide the Toolbar completely, uncheck both options.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Find and Replace" class="dashAnchor"></a>Find and Replace</h2><p>The Find and Replace dialog allows you to search your entireapplication, a portion of the application, multiple files in adirectory, or stacks specified in your application’s <strong>stackFiles</strong>property. You can search for object names, scripts, field &amp; button text,custom properties, and other properties. After performing a search youcan replace the search term with a replacement term, either in all ofthe results or on a selection of the results.</p><p><img src="images/image53.png" alt=""/></p><p>Figure 12 – Find and Replace</p><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Find field</strong></td><td>Enter a search term.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Search In menu</strong></td><td>A menu with the following options:<br><br><strong>The current selection</strong> – Searches the currently selected objects<br><br><strong>This card</strong> – Searches the current card of the front most editable stack<br><br><strong>This stack</strong> – Searches the front-most editable stack<br><br><strong>This stack File</strong> – Searches the mainStack and all of the subStacks within the stack file associated with the current front most editable stack<br><br><strong>This stack file and its stack files</strong> – Includes the stacks referenced in this stacks stackFiles property.
