You do this using score contexts. A score has a contextproperty that holds a 64-bit integer. The value stored in this propertyis stored along with the score. Game Center doesn’t use this value atall, nor does it affect score formatting. Your game is free to use thisinteger to store whatever information you want.<b>ul</b><b>li</b>You can use thecontext property to store flags that provide additional content. Forexample, in a racing game, you might use the flags to store what kind ofcar the person completed the track with. Then, in your own customleaderboard user interface, you could display the appropriate car imagenext to each score.<b>/li</b><b>li</b>You could record the user’s actions andother data into a file. You then design your game engine to be able toreplay the contents of that file. You store the file on your own serverand use the context field as an index to reference the file. Your customleaderboard user interface can then offer the ability to see exactly howsomeone earned the score.<b>/li</b><b>li</b>You could implement the replaydirectly into your gameplay. For example, in the hypothetical racinggame, you use a player’s replay file to display a phantom car for thecurrent player to race against.<b>/li</b><b>/ul</b> </p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><b>Description</b></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Tags</b></td><td>externals</td></tr></table></body></html>
