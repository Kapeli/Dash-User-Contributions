It provides a simple way to extend the functionality or control set of LiveCode.</p><p>Our focus in LiveCode 8.0 is extensibility. You can now build and share widgets (custom controls) and libraries that are treated by LiveCode as engine level elements.</p><p>LiveCode 8.0 can be thought of as a version 7.0 with a new module allowing extensions to be plugged into the engine. As a result, 8.0 should be as functional and stable as LiveCode 7.0.</p><p>This guide will take you through the process of installing and using these new widgets and libraries and for the adventurous among you, provide a guide to building and sharing your own extensions. </p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/LiveCode Builder Extensions" class="dashAnchor"></a>LiveCode Builder Extensions</h2><p>To make it possible to create extensions and plug them into the LiveCode engine we&#39;ve created a new flavour of our language called <strong><em>LiveCode Builder</em></strong>. LiveCode Builder looks a lot like LiveCode Script so should feel familiar for any seasoned LiveCode developer. There is lots of new syntax which exposes parts of the LiveCode engine that were only previously available to those who were skilled c/c++ developers.</p><p>To learn more about LiveCode Builder and creating extensions, read on.</p><blockquote><p><em>Warning:</em> It is important to stress right at the start that <strong><em>no aspect of LiveCode Builder should be considered final</em></strong>. <strong><em>Every piece of syntax in LiveCode Builder is subject to change</em></strong>.</p></blockquote><h3>Creating LiveCode Builder Extensions</h3><p>We have provided a new &quot;Extension Builder&quot; stack to help make development and packaging of extensions as easy as possible. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> LiveCode Builder is a different flavour of LiveCode so it is not possible to edit LiveCode Builder scripts in the main LiveCode Script IDE.</p></blockquote><h3>Extension Builder</h3><p>Open the &quot;Extension Builder&quot; from the tools menu:</p><pre><code>Tools &gt; Extension Builder</code></pre><p><img src="images/extensions-plugin-overview.png" alt="Extension Builder plugin"/></p><ol><li>Shows the currently selected extension. </li><li>Data that the builder was able to parse from the directory such as icons, resources, API&#39;s the user guides.</li><li>Console: Shows status, error and log messages.</li><li>Test: Creates a stack, compiles the extensions and creates an instance.</li><li>Script: Opens the lcb script in an external default editor.</li><li>Install: Installs the extension into the IDE</li><li>Uninstall: Uninstalls the extension from the IDE</li><li>Package: Creates a .lce package which can uploaded to the extension store. It is placed in the extension directory</li></ol><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> A great way to get started is to tweak the script of one of our widget examples.</p></blockquote><p>Using the selection dropdown (1), you can select the extension you wish to develop or click the &quot;open&quot; icon in the header back to locate an extension you&#39;ve not loaded before. </p><h3>Create your own simple widget</h3><p>The main difference between widgets and libraries is that a widget draws to a pre-existing canvas. Apart from that, the authoring process is much the same for both extension types.</p><h4>Create a .lcb file</h4><p>We recommend using the Atom text editor, available at <a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a>. A LiveCode package is available which provides some colorization as well as indentation. If you prefer to use TextWrangler, there is a colorising script <a href="https://github.com/livecode/livecode/tree/develop/contrib/TextWrangler">here</a>. It should be placed in /Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/</p><p>Start by creating a plain text file in a new directory and save it to disk with the extension &quot;lcb&quot;:</p><pre><code>/Desktop/widgettest/main.lcb</code></pre><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> The extension builder currently relies on there being only one <strong><em>.lcb</em></strong> file in a given directory. </p></blockquote><h4>Declare Type and Identifier</h4><p>Start by declaring the type of extension, either &quot;widget&quot; or &quot;library&quot; followed by your identifier (See &quot;Select A Developer ID&quot; below).</p><pre><code>widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircle   ## Code for your widgetend widget</code></pre><p>This is the unique identifier by which your extension will be referred to by the LiveCode Engine.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> All LiveCode authored widgets are in the application package at /Tools/Extensions/. To play with one of these extensions we recommend copying the folder from the application package to your desktop and loading it from there. Changing the extension identifier in the source code will ensure it doesn&#39;t conflict with the existing extension.</p></blockquote><h4>Declare Metadata</h4><p>Next, provide metadata to help LiveCode display your widget correctly in the IDE and in the online portal.</p><pre><code>widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCirclemetadata title is &quot;My Pink Circle&quot;metadata author is &quot;Benjamin Beaumont&quot;metadata version is &quot;1.0.0&quot;end widget</code></pre><h4>Importing libraries</h4><p>The LiveCode builder syntax is broken down into <strong>modules</strong>. There are 3 classes of module:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Default</td><td>These modules are part of LiveCode builder and are included by default. Their syntax is always available to you as a LiveCode developer.</td></tr><tr><td>Optional</td><td>These modules are created and distributed by LiveCode Ltd and must be imported by the extension developer in order to make use of their syntax.</td></tr><tr><td>Custom</td><td>These modules are created and distributed through the online portal and must be imported by the extension developer in order to make use of their syntax.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>LiveCode builder contains the following modules:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Module</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>com.livecode.canvas</td><td>Optional</td><td>Provides the syntax and types for 2D drawing allowing developers to draw to a canvas. Required if creating a widget.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.widget</td><td>Optional</td><td>Contains syntax specific to widget building such as &quot;my width&quot; and &quot;the mouse position&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.engine</td><td>Optional</td><td>Contains syntax for all extension building such as &quot;dispatch&quot; and &quot;log&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.arithmetic</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for basic mathematical operations.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.array</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for operations on arrays.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.binary</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for operations on binary data.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.bitwise</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for bitwise logical operators.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.byte</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for operations on byte chunks.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.char</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for operations on char chunks.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.codeunit</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for operations on codeunit chunks.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.date</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for accessing the date and time.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.file</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for file I/O operations.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.foreign</td><td>Default</td><td>Provides the type bindings for foreign types.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.list</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for operations on lists.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.logic</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for logical operators.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.mathfoundation</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for foundational mathematical operations.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.math</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for mathematical operations.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.sort</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for sorting operations.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.stream</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for stream I/O operations.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.string</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for operations on strings.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.system</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for accessing system information.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.type</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for general operations on types.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.typeconvert</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for conversions between types.</td></tr><tr><td>com.livecode.unittest</td><td>Default</td><td>Contains syntax for unit testing LiveCode Builder programs.</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><strong>Warning!</strong> Module names are subject to change.</p></blockquote><p>The new LiveCode dictionary has a full list of all available syntax as well as the module each belongs to. As a general rule we recommend importing all three optional module whenever developing widgets.</p><pre><code>widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircleuse com.livecode.canvasuse com.livecode.widgetuse com.livecode.enginemetadata title is &quot;My Pink Circle&quot;metadata author is &quot;Benjamin Beaumont&quot;metadata version is &quot;1.0.0&quot;end widget</code></pre><h4>Core Handlers</h4><p>There are three core handlers that any widget developer should implement:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Handler</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OnPaint</td><td>The <em>OnPaint</em> message is sent to your widget whenever LiveCode requires it to redraw. The performance of your widget is tied primarily to this handler and should be kept as efficient as possible.</td></tr><tr><td>OnCreate</td><td>The <em>OnCreate</em> message is sent to your widget when it is first created by LiveCode. This can be used to initialise default data and where applicable, reduce the burden for calculating constants etc in the onPaint handler.</td></tr><tr><td>OnGeometryChanged</td><td>The <em>OnGeometryChanged</em> message is sent when the control is changed in size.</td></tr><tr><td>OnSave</td><td>The <em>OnSave</em> message is sent when your widget is about to be destroyed and enables the widget to save data set on the widget.</td></tr><tr><td>OnLoad</td><td>The <em>OnLoad</em> message is sent when your widget is created and enables the widget to retrieve data saved on the widget.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the most basic example, only the OnPaint() handler is required.</p><pre><code>widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCirclemetadata title is &quot;My Pink Circle&quot;metadata author is &quot;Benjamin Beaumont&quot;metadata version is &quot;1.0.0&quot;public handler OnPaint()   // Draw widgetend handlerend widget</code></pre><h4>Draw a Pink Circle</h4><pre><code>widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCirclemetadata title is &quot;My Pink Circle&quot;metadata author is &quot;Benjamin Beaumont&quot;metadata version is &quot;1.0.0&quot;use com.livecode.canvaspublic handler OnPaint()   // Create a path with a radius of half the width of the canvas   // Set the paint to a solid pink color   // Fill the path   variable tCirclePath as Path   put circle path centered at point [my width / 2, my height / 2] with radius (my width/2) into tCirclePath   set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [1, 0, 1]   fill tCirclePath on this canvasend handlerend widget</code></pre><h4>Test the Code</h4><p>Now open the extension builder stack as shown above and click on the folder icon at the top right to load your <strong><em>.lcb</em></strong> file into the builder.</p><p><img src="images/extensions-widget-first.png" alt="enter image description here"/></p><p>Click test. Your widget should be displayed on the new stack. If you can&#39;t see it, check behind the extension stack.</p><h4>Properties</h4><p>In order to make a widget useful to end users it is likely that you&#39;ll want to expose properties that allow them to specify how your widget should behave. </p><p>To specify a property you must provide a name and the method to get and set the property.</p><pre><code>property &lt;name&gt; get &lt;variable/handler&gt; set &lt;variable/handler&gt;</code></pre><p>The simplest properties to get/set are numbers or strings. So lets create a circleMargin property that allows users to define a margin.</p><pre><code>property circleMargin get mMargin set setMargin</code></pre><p>In the above example, when the <strong><em>circleMargin</em></strong> property is requested, the variable &quot;mMargin&quot; is returned, when set, the handler &quot;setMargin&quot; is called. To have LiveCode Builder handle the getting/setting of data, provide the variable name, to take full control over the getting/setting process define handlers. In our case we&#39;re taking a mixed approach.</p><pre><code>private variable mMargin as Real</code></pre><p>We&#39;ll define a member variable to store the value for the margin. LiveCode Builder is typed so you must also specify the type of your variable. Remember, the canvas you are drawing to has subpixel precision so our margin can be a decimal number. As a result, we&#39;ve chosen to specify our margin as a real number. For a full list of types available in LiveCode Builder please see the Typing section of the language specification guide. We also suggest a naming convention for variables in the section on variable and case sensitivity.</p><p>We also need to insatiate our circleMargin to a default value. We do this by adding an OnCreate handler which is called when the widget is first created.</p><pre><code>public handler OnCreate()     put 0 into mMarginend handler</code></pre><p>Finally we have to implement our <code>setMargin</code> handler.</p><pre><code>public handler setMargin(in pMargin as Real) returns nothing    put pMargin into mMargin    redraw allend handler</code></pre><p>Implementing the &quot;setter&quot; ourselves provides us with a little more flexibility. In this case when the property is set we want our pink circle to immediately redraw to reflect the property change. We do this by calling &quot;redraw all&quot;.</p><p>To test the property click &quot;test&quot; and from the message box set the property.</p><pre><code>set the cicleMargin of widget 1 to 15</code></pre><p><strong>Full Example</strong></p><pre><code>widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCirclemetadata title is &quot;My Pink Circle&quot;metadata author is &quot;Benjamin Beaumont&quot;metadata version is &quot;1.0.0&quot;use com.livecode.canvasuse com.livecode.widgetuse com.livecode.engine// Propertiesproperty circleMargin get mMargin set setMargin// Local variablesprivate variable mMargin as Realpublic handler onCreate()     put 0 into mMarginend handlerpublic handler OnPaint()   // Create a path with a radius of half the width of the canvas   // Set the paint to a solid pink color   // Fill the path   variable tCirclePath as Path   put circle path centered at point [my width / 2, my height / 2] with radius ((my width - mMargin)/2) into tCirclePath   set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [1, 0, 1]   fill tCirclePath on this canvasend handlerpublic handler setMargin(in pMargin as Real)    put pMargin into mMargin    redraw allend handlerend widget</code></pre><h4>Loading and Saving widget data</h4><p>When your widget is created you are sent an <em>OnSave</em> message. It has the following structure and expects and array return type. You can fill this array with whatever widget data you have. LiveCode saves this data along with instances of the widget in the stack file.</p><pre><code>public handler OnSave(out rProperties as Array)    put the empty array into rProperties    put mMargin into rProperties[&quot;margin&quot;]    return rPropertiesend handler</code></pre><p>This same array will be returned to you when the widget is next opened.</p><pre><code>public handler OnLoad(in pProperties as Array)    put pProperties[&quot;margin&quot;] into mMarginend handler</code></pre><h4>Understanding Error Messages</h4><p>Clicking on the &quot;test&quot; button causes the extension builder to compile your source code file (***.lcb***) and produce a compiled module file (***.lcm***). If an error is encountered it is output in the &quot;console&quot; section of the builder:</p><pre><code>Error: &lt;source path&gt;: &lt;line number&gt;: &lt;char number&gt;: &lt;error message&gt;</code></pre><ul><li><em>source path</em> - The path the .lcb file that is being compiled</li><li><em>line number</em> - The line number in the script on which the error occurred.</li><li><em>char number</em> - The character number on which the error occurred. </li><li><em>error message</em> - The description of the error.</li></ul><h4>LiveCode Builder API</h4><p>To start creating more complex widgets see the LiveCode Builder api in the documentation stack in the IDE.</p><p><img src="images/extensions-canvas-docs.png" alt="enter image description here"/></p><ol><li>Open the dictionary (and stay in the &#39;API&#39; tab)</li><li>Click the drop-down button</li><li>Choose the &quot;LiveCode Builder&quot; API</li><li>The list of all the syntax available</li></ol><h3>Creating Libraries</h3><p>A extension library is written in much the same way as the above widget. The only difference is that all the public handlers implemented are loaded into the engine on startup.</p><h3>Loading and Creating Widgets Manually</h3><p>To load a compiled library file call:</p><pre><code>load extension &lt;filepath.lcm&gt;</code></pre><p>To create a widget from script call:</p><pre><code>create widget &lt;name&gt; as &lt;identifier&gt;</code></pre><p>e.g.</p><pre><code>create widget &quot;myWidget&quot; as &quot;com.livecode.extensions.waddingham.clock&quot; </code></pre><h3>Composed Widgets</h3><p>Widgets can either be &#39;host&#39; widgets, as in the previous example, created when a widget is directly embedded in a stack, or &#39;child&#39; widgets which are created when a widget is used as a child widget within another widget.The syntax for composed widgets is included in the com.livecode.widget module.</p><h4>A simple composed widget</h4><p>This composed widget example composes the clock widget and the selector widget, to create a version of the clock widget with adjustable time zone.<img src="images/extensions-composed.png" alt="enter image description here"/>The label at the top of the widget reflects which portion of the widget the mouse is over.</p><pre><code>widget com.livecode.extensions.example.simplecomposeduse com.livecode.canvasuse com.livecode.widgetmetadata title is &quot;Simple Composed Widget&quot;metadata author is &quot;LiveCode&quot;metadata version is &quot;1.0.0&quot;private variable mInsideChild as Stringprivate variable mInside as Booleanprivate variable mSelector as Widgetprivate variable mClock as Widgetpublic handler OnCreate()    put false into mInside    put the empty string into mInsideChild    put a new widget &quot;com.livecode.extensions.livecode.selector&quot; into mSelector    set property &quot;numSelections&quot; of mSelector to 6    set annotation &quot;Name&quot; of mSelector to &quot;Selector&quot;    put a new widget &quot;com.livecode.extensions.livecode.clock&quot; into mClock    set annotation &quot;Name&quot; of mClock to &quot;Clock&quot;    place mSelector    place mClockend handlerend widget</code></pre><p>Notice that Widget is a variable type. This widget stores references to its child widgets in private variables. In the <code>OnCreate</code> handler, the widget objects are created, stored in the private variables and &#39;placed&#39;. Child widgets can be stored as variables and manipulated without actually being drawn to a canvas if they are unplaced.Properties implemented by child widgets can be got and set using the <code>property &lt;propName&gt; of &lt;child widget&gt;</code> syntax.Placing a widget ensures that they are drawn, in placement order. Setting an annotation of a child widget assigns it a tag so that when an unknown child widget is returned by an operator, its annotation can be used to identify it.</p><pre><code>public handler OnMouseEnter()    put true into mInside    if the target is not nothing then        put annotation &quot;Name&quot; of the target into mInsideChild    end if    redraw allend handlerpublic handler OnMouseLeave()    if the target is not nothing then        put the empty string into mInsideChild    end if    put false into mInside    redraw allend handler</code></pre><p>In the <em>OnMouseEnter</em> and <em>OnMouseLeave</em> handlers, <em>the target</em> is used to obtain a reference to the child widget that triggered the <em>OnMouseEnter</em> and <em>OnMouseLeave</em> events, and the previously assigned annotation put into the <code>mInsideChild</code> variable, which in turn is rendered to the canvas in the <em>OnPaint</em> handler.</p><pre><code>public handler OnPaint()    set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [0.75, 0.75, 0.75]    fill rectangle path of my bounds on this canvas    if mInside then        set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]        set the stroke width of this canvas to 4.0        stroke rectangle path of my bounds on this canvas    end if    if mInsideChild is not the empty string then        set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]        fill text mInsideChild at top of my bounds on this canvas    end ifend handler</code></pre><p>The rectangle of each child widget is controlled using the following syntax:* <code>the rectangle of &lt;widget&gt;</code> - Enables manipulation of the rectangle property of a child widget.* <code>the width of &lt;widget&gt;</code> - Enables manipulation of the width property of a child widget.* <code>the height of &lt;widget&gt;</code> - Enables manipulation of the height property of a child widget.* <code>the location of &lt;widget&gt;</code> - Enables manipulation of the location property of a child widget.</p><pre><code>public handler OnGeometryChanged()    set the rectangle of mSelector to rectangle [ 0, 20, my width, 50 ]    set the rectangle of mClock to rectangle [ 0, 50, my width, my height ]end handler</code></pre><p>Finally, messages posted by child widgets can be handled in the direct parent by handling the appropriate message (prepending &#39;On&#39;). For example, the selector widget posts <em>optionChanged</em> when one of its numbers is selected. This is handled by this composed widget example in an <em>OnOptionChanged</em> handler.</p><pre><code>public handler OnOptionChanged(in pIndex)    set property &quot;timeZone&quot; of mClock to pIndex - 1end handler</code></pre><h3>Documenting Your Extension</h3><p>Extensions can provide an API (Dictionary) and User Guide as part of the installed package. They are installed and viewable through the LiveCode Dictionary stack.</p><p><strong>API (Dictionary)</strong></p><p><img src="images/extensions-documentation.png" alt="enter image description here"/></p><ol><li>Open the documentation stack from the menubar</li><li>API chooser - Choose which API to view. By default, LiveCode 8.0 comes with the LiveCode Script API and the new LiveCode Builder API. Any extension that contains an API is displayed here.</li><li>Category Filter - Click on the tags to filter the API entries. </li><li>Search Filter - Enter a text string to filter the API entries by a specific search string</li><li>History - Move back and forward through your API navigation history</li><li>Entry List - Select the entry to display from this list</li><li>Entry - The entry describing the syntax</li></ol><p><strong>User Guide</strong></p><p><img src="images/extensions-guides.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/></p><ol><li>Click on the &quot;Guide&quot; tab at the top of the documentation stack</li><li>Select the guide you wish to view</li></ol><blockquote><p>Note: In LiveCode 8.0 we&#39;ll be including an updated version of the LiveCode Script User Guide. The version currently included with LiveCode has not yet been updated.</p></blockquote><h4>Adding API Markup</h4><p>Any extension can include an API. To do so, either add a file called <em>api.lcdoc</em> to your widget folder alongside the other widget files or markup your source code inline.</p><p>Marking up your scripts is simple and follows a similar model to other documentation formats.</p><p>Consider the following handler</p><pre><code>public handler myHandler(in pString as String, in pNumber as Number)   # Code end handler</code></pre><p>To add an entry to the API for this handler, place a formatted comment above the handler definition:</p><pre><code>/*summary: Use this handler to do an actionpString: This parameter does xpNumber: This parameter does ydescription:# Markdown TitleHere is a full description in markdown for how this function works. Once again, any GitHub flavoured markdown is accepted.*/public handler myHandler(in pString as String, in pNumber as Number)   # Code end handler</code></pre><p>The LiveCode API parser will combine the comment items with other data pulled directly from your handler definition such as name, type and some parameter details.</p><p>For a full list of acceptable documentation elements please see the LiveCode DocumentationFormat guide.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> Documentation is only added to the LiveCode dictionary when a full extension package is installed. Currently, this is only possible through the extensionbuilder.</p></blockquote><h4>Adding a User Guide</h4><p>Any extension can include a user guide. To do so, add a markdown file called <em>guide.md</em> to your widget folder alongside the other widget files.</p><p>All GitHub flavoured markdown is accepted.</p><h3>Packaging Extensions</h3><p>Packaging extensions is easy. Simply open the &quot;Extension Builder&quot; stack:</p><pre><code>Tools &gt; Extension Builder</code></pre><p>Load your <strong><em>.lcb</em></strong> file and click &quot;Build Package&quot;. A new file will appears in the same directory as your main file with the extension <strong><em>.lce</em></strong>. This is your final package file ready for upload to the extensions portal.</p><h4>Package requirements</h4><p>A valid package can be built from a minimum set of files:</p><pre><code>widget.lcb // Widget source filesupport/icon.png // 20x40 png imagesupport/icon@extra-high.png // 40x80 png image</code></pre><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/The Extension Store" class="dashAnchor"></a>The Extension Store</h2><p>Once you have created and packaged your extension you can make it available to the LiveCode Community via the <a href="https://livecode.com/products/extensions">Extension Store</a>, in the <a href="https://livecode.com/products/widgets/">widgets</a> section.</p><h3>Registering as an Extension Developer</h3><p>The first step is to <a href="https://livecode.com/account/developer/register">register</a> as an Extension Developer.</p><ul><li>Log in to your LiveCode Account</li><li>Select the Register option under the Developer section</li></ul><p><img src="images/extensions-developer_id.png" alt="enter image description here"/></p><p>LiveCode Extensions must have unique identifiers. These identifiers use reverse domain notation.</p><p>You can sign up on this page for a LiveCode Community Developer ID. Having a developer ID will allow you to use extension identifiers of the form: <code>community.livecode.developerID.extensionName</code>.</p><p>Choose the Developer ID you want to use here. If your chosen ID is already in use you will be asked to choose a different one.</p><h3>Uploading Extensions to the Store</h3><p>To upload a packaged extension to the store log in to your LiveCode account and go to the <a href="https://livecode.com/account/developer/extensions">Extensions</a> section of the Developer area.</p><p>Any extensions you have uploaded will be shown here, and you have the option to add new extensions.</p><ul><li>Click the &quot;Add New Extension&quot; button (if available)</li><li>Drag your packaged extension (<code>.lce</code>) file into the upload area</li><li>When the extension has uploaded it will appear in your list</li></ul><p><img src="images/extensions-upload.png" alt="enter image description here"/></p><h3>Activating your Extension</h3><p>When an extension is first uploaded it is not active so will not show in the Extension Store.</p><p>To activate your extension click &quot;activate&quot; under Status. At this stage you will be warned if any information is missing and you can add it by clicking the &quot;Edit&quot; button.</p><p><img src="images/extensions-activate.png" alt="enter image description here"/></p><p>Once your extension is activated its status will change to &quot;Active&quot;.</p><h3>The Extension Store in the Extension Manager</h3><p>You can view and downlaod extensions via the Extension Store. To see the extensions that are available to download open the Extension Manager from the LiveCode Tools menu and select the &quot;Store&quot; tab.</p><p><img src="images/extensions-store.png" alt="enter image description here"/></p><p>You can also download extensions from the <a href="https://livecode.com/products/widgets/">Widget Store</a> on the LiveCode website then install the downloaded extension using the Extension Manager.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Other ways to extend the Built-in Capabilities" class="dashAnchor"></a>Other ways to extend the Built-in Capabilities</h2><p>There are many other ways to extend LiveCode. This section explains how to run shell commands, start other applications, read and write to processes, execute AppleScript, VBScript, send and respond to AppleEvents and communicate between multiple LiveCode-based processes. It also tells you where to get information to create external commands and functions (code written in lower level languages).</p><h3>Communicating with other process and applications</h3><h4>Reading and writing to the command shell</h4><p>Use the <strong>shell</strong> function to run shell commands and return the result. The following example displays a directory listing on Mac OS X:</p><pre><code>answer shell(&quot;ls&quot;)</code></pre><p>And this example stores a directory listing in a variable on Windows:</p><pre><code>put shell(&quot;dir&quot;) into tDirectory</code></pre><p>On Windows systems you can prevent a terminal window from being displayed by setting the <strong>hideConsoleWindows</strong> global property to true.</p><p>You can choose a different shell program by setting the <strong>shellPath</strong> global property. By default this is set to &quot;/bin/sh&quot; on Mac OS X and Linux and &quot;command.com&quot; on Windows.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> The shell function blocks LiveCode until it is completed. If you want to run a shell command in the background, write the shell script to a text file then execute it with the <code>launch</code>command.</p></blockquote><h4>Launching other applications</h4><p>Use the <strong>launch</strong> command to launch other applications, documents or URLs. To launch an application, supply the full path to the application. The following example opens a text document with TextEdit on OS X:</p><pre><code>launch &quot;/Users/someuser/Desktop/text document.rtf&quot; with &quot;/Applications/TextEdit.app&quot;</code></pre><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To get the path to an application, use the <code>answer file</code> command to select the application then copy it into your script. Run this in the message box: <code>answer file &quot;Select an application&quot;; put it</code></p></blockquote><p>To open a document with the application it is associated with use the <strong>launch document</strong> command.</p><pre><code>launch document &quot;C:/My document.pdf&quot;</code></pre><p>To open a URL in the default web browser, use the <strong>launch URL</strong> command.</p><pre><code>launch URL &quot;&lt;http://www.livecode.com/&gt;&quot;</code></pre><p>For more information on launching URLs and details on how to render web pages within LiveCode, see the Transferring Information guide.</p><h4>Closing another application</h4><p>Use the <strong>kill process</strong> command to send a signal to another application, to close it or to force it to exit. For more details, see the LiveCode Dictionary.</p><h4>Communicating with other processes</h4><p>Use the <strong>open process</strong> command to open an application or process you want to read and write data from. You can then read from the process with the <strong>read from process</strong> command and write to it with the <strong>write to process</strong> command. To close a process you have opened, use the <strong>close process</strong> command. The <strong>openProcesses</strong> returns a list of processes you have opened and the <strong>openProcessIDs</strong> returns the process IDs of each one. For more details see the <em>LiveCode Dictionary</em>.</p><h4>Using AppleScript and VBScript (Open Scripting Architecture or Windows Scripting Host)</h4><p>To execute commands using AppleScript on Mac OS or VBScript on Windows, use the <strong>do as</strong> command. <strong>do as</strong> also allows you to use any other <em>Open Scripting Architecture</em> languages on Mac OS or languages installed into the <em>Windows Scripting Host</em> on Windows. To retrieve a list of the available installed languages, use the <strong>alternateLanguages</strong>.</p><p>For example, to execute an AppleScript that brings the Finder on OS X to the front, enter the following into a field:</p><p><em>tell application &quot;Finder&quot;</em><em>activate</em><em>end tell</em></p><p>Then run:</p><pre><code>do field 1 as &quot;appleScript&quot;</code></pre><p>To retrieve a result from commands executed using <code>do as</code>, use <code>the result</code> function. Any error message will also be returned in <code>the result</code>. The following example displays <code>the result</code> of an addition performed using VBScript:</p><pre><code>do &quot;result = 1 + 1&quot; as &quot;vbscript&quot;answer the result</code></pre><p>For more information on the do as command, see the LiveCode Dictionary.</p><h4>AppleEvents</h4><p>To send an AppleEvent, use the <strong>send to program</strong> command.</p><p>If LiveCode receives an AppleEvent it will send an <strong>appleEvent</strong> message to the current card. Intercept this message to perform actions such as handling a request to quit your application or opening a document. The following example shows how you could handle a request to quit:</p><pre><code>on appleEvent pClass, pID, pSender    if pClass &amp; pID is &quot;aevtquit&quot; then    -- call a function that prompts the user to save changes    put checkSaveChanges() into tOkToQuit    -- returns false if the user presses &quot;cancel&quot;    if tOkToQuit is true then quit    else exit appleEvent    end ifend appleEvent</code></pre><p>To retrive additional information passed with the appleEvent use the <strong>request appleEvent data</strong> command. The following example shows how you could handle a request to open a stack:</p><pre><code>on appleEvent pClass, pID, pSender    --appleEvent sent when stack is opened from the finder    if pClass &amp; pID is &quot; aevtodoc &quot; then        -- get the file path(s)        request AppleEvent data        put it into tFilesList        repeat for each line l in tFilesList            go stack l        end repeat    end ifend appleEvent</code></pre><p>For more details see the <em>LiveCode Dictionary</em>.</p><h4>Using Local sockets</h4><p>If you want to communicate between local applications a common technique that can be used without code changes on all the platforms LiveCode supports, is to open a local socket and communicate using that. You should choose a port number that is not used by a standard protocol – typically a high number.</p><p>This technique is commonly used when you want to create multiple programs that run independently but communicate with each other. It is a viable technique for running background tasks and provides a straightforward way to create an application that behaves as if threaded – i.e. with benefits of multiple threads. You can design your application such that additional instances can be launched to perform processing, data transfer or other intensive activities. Modern OSes will allocate each application to an appropriate processor core. By using socket messaging to communicate with each one you can keep your main application&#39;s user interface responsive and display status information. The following example shows you how to open a socket to the local machine:</p><pre><code>open socket to &quot;127.0.0.1:10000&quot; with message gotConnection</code></pre><p>A detailed discussion of how to create a protocol using sockets can be found in the Transferring Information guide.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To simplify communication between multiple LiveCode programs, consider writing a simple library that sends and receives a handler name together with parameter data. To call a handler in the other LiveCode program, send the handler name and data to the library. The library will send the data over a socket. In the receiving program intercept the incoming data from the socket and use it to call the appropriate message with the parameter data received.</p></blockquote><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Externals – code written in lower level languages" class="dashAnchor"></a>Externals – code written in lower level languages</h2><p>LiveCode provides an external interface which allows you to extend it using a lower level language (often C). For example, if you have preexisting code that performs processing in a lower level language, you can write a user interface in LiveCode and then call this library by writing a simple wrapper around it using LiveCode&#39;s externals interface. LiveCode supports transmitting data to and from externals, as well as drawing into image objects within LiveCode windows, manipulating the player object, and more.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Some aspects of the built in functionality are supplied in the form of externals. These include the SSL library, the database library, the revBrowser library, zip library, video grabber and XML libraries. These libraries can be included in a standalone application, or excluded if they are not needed – saving disk space.</p></blockquote><h3>The Externals SDK</h3><p>We provide a developer kit for writing externals which includes documentation and examples. You may download this kit from:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.runrev.com/resources/externals/revexternalssdk.zip">http://downloads.runrev.com/resources/externals/revexternalssdk.zip</a></p><p>The following newsletter articles will also help you get started:</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://newsletters.livecode.com/november/issue13/newsletter5.php">External Writing for the Uninitiated – Part 1</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://newsletters.livecode.com/november/issue14/newsletter3.php">External Writing for the Uninitiated – Part 2</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://newsletters.livecode.com/october/issue34/newsletter1.php">Writing Externals for Linux with 2.9 or later</a></p></li></ul></body></html>
