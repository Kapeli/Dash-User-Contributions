You can get data from single-user and multi-userdatabases, update data in them, get information about the databasestructure, and display data from the database in your stack. For a discussion of when it is appropriate to use an external database with LiveCode, see the topic When to Use a Database in the <em>LiveCode Script</em> guide.</p><p>This guide discusses how to install necessary software to communicatewith databases, and how to use the Database library to communicate between LiveCode and a database.</p><p>This topic does not include discussion of how to set up and create a SQLdatabase, which is beyond the scope of the LiveCode documentation.</p><p>To fully understand this topic, you should know how to write shortscripts and should understand the basic concepts of SQL databases (rowsand columns, database cursors, and SQL queries).</p><p>A few terms used in this topic, such as &quot;field&quot; and &quot;cursor&quot;, are partof the standard terminology for working with databases, but have adifferent meaning in the context of LiveCode development. When goingback and forth between database work and more general applicationdevelopment, be sure you understand which meaning is applicable in thecontext you&#39;re currently working in. When referring to database-specificterms, the documentation usually uses phrases like &quot;database field&quot; or&quot;database cursor&quot; to remind you of the context. See the Glossary withinthe product documentation for definitions of any term you are unsure of.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Introduction to Database Access" class="dashAnchor"></a>Introduction to Database Access</h2><p>A database is an external resource that holds information, structured ina special form for quick access and retrieval. Databases can be:</p><ul><li>any size from small to extremely large </li><li>located on the same system as the application or on a remote server </li><li>accessible by one user at a time or by many users at once</li></ul><h3>SQL Databases</h3><p>A SQL database is a database that you access and control using SQL, astandard database-access language which is widely supported. You use SQLqueries (statements in the SQL language) to specify the part of thedatabase you want to work with, to get data, or to make changes to thedatabase.</p><p>LiveCode&#39;s database access is fully-featured. You can send any SQLstatement to a database. You can open multiple databases (or multipleconnections to the same database), maintain multiple record sets(database cursors) per connection, and send and receive binary data aswell as text. You can do all this using the commands and functions in the <em>Database library</em>.</p><p>To see a list of LiveCode terms in the Database library, open the<em>Dictionary</em>, and type &quot;*database*&quot; into the search filter field.</p><h3>The Basics of Database Structure</h3><p>A database is built of records, which in turn are built out of databasefields. A field is the smallest part of a database that can beseparately addressed. Each database field contains a particular kind ofinformation. This might be a name, a file path, a picture, or any otherkind of information. Each record contains one value for each of itsfields. A set of records is called a database table, and one or moretables comprise a database.</p><p>Here&#39;s an example: suppose you have a database of customers for yourbusiness. The fields of this database might include the customer name, aunique customer ID number, and shipping address. Each record consists ofthe information for a single customer, so each record has a differentcustomer name, shipping address, and so on.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may have noticed that the database structure beingdescribed resembles a multiple-card stack that has the same fields oneach card. A database field is like a field in a stack, and a recordis like a card. A stack set up this way can act as a database, infact, but lacks some of the features of an external database, such asthe ability to perform SQL queries and the ability to perform robustlywhen accessed by more than one user.</p></blockquote><p>You can also think of the set of customer records as a grid (like aspreadsheet). Each row is a record, and each column is a field, so eachcell in the grid contains a different piece of information about aparticular customer. Here&#39;s an example:</p><table><thead><tr><th>ID</th><th>Customer Name</th><th>Address</th><th>Country</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>123</td><td>Jane Jones</td><td>234 E. Street</td><td>U.K.</td></tr><tr><td>836</td><td>Acme Corporation</td><td>PO Box 23788</td><td>USA</td></tr><tr><td>823</td><td>CanCo, Inc.</td><td>1 CanCo Blvd.</td><td>Japan</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Figure 59 – Example Database Grid</p><p>There are three rows in this grid (each is the record for a particularcustomer) and four columns (each is one of the fields).</p><p>A row of the database means one single customer record, which has onevalue for each field. A column of the database means the set of allvalues for one of the fields, one for each record (for example, the setof all customer addresses).</p><p>More generally, each row describes one of the things in the database,and each column describes a particular state for each thing in thedatabase.</p><p>The set of all customer records makes a table. Your database mightinclude only this table, or it might include other related tables, suchas a list of all sales. You can also connect related data from differenttables of the same database. For example, if each record in the Salestable includes the ID number of the customer who bought the product, youcan link all the sales records for a customer to that customer&#39;s recordin the Customers table.</p><h3>SQL and Record Sets – Database Cursors</h3><p>SQL works primarily with sets of records, rather than individual rows.When you send a SQL query to a database, the query typically selectscertain records which you can perform further operations on. The set ofrecords resulting from a SQL query is called a database cursor, orrecord set. SQL queries let you describe the characteristics of therecords you require, instead of processing each record one by one tofind out whether it matches your criteria.</p><p>For example, consider the customer table we talked about in the previoussection. To work with only US customers, you can write a SQL query thatselects only records where the country field is &quot;USA&quot;. This subset ofrecords then becomes a record set. You can find out more about thefields and records contained in this record set, and move from record torecord within this subset of the database. You can create more than onerecord set to work with more than one set of records at a time.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Different database implementations have differentlimitations on movement within a record set. For example, somedatabases won&#39;t let you move backward within a record set: instead,you must start at the first record and move forward in order toexamine the data.</p></blockquote><h3>Choosing a Database</h3><p>LiveCode directly supports the following database implementations:</p><ul><li>MySQL </li><li>SQLite </li><li>PostgreSQL</li></ul><p>LiveCode also supports connecting to a database via ODBC. You can useODBC to use Access, FileMaker, MS SQL Server and many other databaseimplementations. See below for more information about ODBC.</p><p>LiveCode&#39;s database commands and functions use the same syntaxregardless of what type of database you are connecting to. You don&#39;tneed to learn a separate database language for each type. Instead, whenyou first open a database with the <strong>revOpenDatabase</strong> function, youspecify the type as one of the parameters so LiveCode knows what type ofdatabase it&#39;s dealing with. The Database library handles the details ofeach type behind the scenes for you.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Reasons to Choose a Database Type" class="dashAnchor"></a>Reasons to Choose a Database Type</h2><p>Which type of database to choose depends on a number of factors. If youneed to work with an existing database, or already have a databasemanager installed, the decision is made for you. Likewise, if you&#39;realready an expert at a particular database implementation, you&#39;llprobably prefer to go on using that one.</p><p>Other factors in your choice may include price, performance, licensingmodel (commercial or open source), and platform support. If your usersare on a particular set of platforms, you&#39;ll need to choose a databasethat is supported on all those platforms. Runtime do not endorse anyparticular database type, the information provided on the differenttypes is for informational purposes only.</p><h3>Overview of ODBC</h3><p>Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a system that allows developers toaccess any type of compatible database in a standard way.</p><p>To communicate with a database, you usually have to add code that usesthe database&#39;s own proprietary protocols. Without ODBC, in order tocreate a program that can communicate with--for example--FileMaker,Access, and Oracle databases, LiveCode would have to include code forthree different database protocols. With ODBC, LiveCode can communicatewith any of these database types using the same code.</p><p><strong>ODBC Managers</strong></p><p>To work with databases through ODBC, you need two pieces of software: anODBC manager, plus a database driver for the specific database typeyou&#39;re using.</p><p>Windows and OS X include ODBC software with the operating system. For Linux systems, you can download an ODBC manager and a set of drivers (see the section below titled &quot;Software for Database Access&quot; for more information).</p><h3>Performance for Direct Access Versus ODBC Access</h3><p>Typically, accessing a database via ODBC takes more configuration and isslower than accessing the database directly. For this reason, LiveCodeprovides the ability to access MySQL, PostgreSQL databases directly without going through the ODBC protocol. This ability will be valuable for anyone doing complex or extensive professional database work.</p><p>The syntax of the functions in the Database library is identical for alldatabase types, so you do not need to rewrite your scripts to takeadvantage of the increased efficiency of direct access.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Software for Database Access" class="dashAnchor"></a>Software for Database Access</h2><p>To provide connectivity to databases, LiveCode works with databasedrivers--software that translates application requests into the protocolrequired by a specific database.</p><h3>Finding Database Drivers</h3><p>Database drivers for certain database types are included in the LiveCodedistribution. (The list of included database types depends on theplatform.) The sections below list which database drivers are includedwith which platforms.</p><p>If you have installed LiveCode, you have all the software needed to usethe included database types. For other database types, you will need toobtain the appropriate database drivers before you can work with thosedatabases.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> This section includes links to third-party web sitesand contains information about third-party software. This informationis provided for your convenience, but LiveCode is not responsible forthe software packages and sites referenced. Runtime regrets that itcannot provide any support for installation and configuration of anydatabasae.</p></blockquote><h3>MySQL</h3><p>MySQL database drivers are included as part of the LiveCode installationon Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows systems.</p><h3>PostgreSQL</h3><p>A PostgreSQL database driver is included as part of the LiveCodeinstallation on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows systems.</p><h3>SQLite</h3><p>Drivers for accessing this database are included with LiveCode. Noadditional installation is necessary.</p><h3>ODBC managers and database drivers</h3><p>To use a database via ODBC, you must install the necessary ODBC softwarefor your platform. (Some operating systems include an ODBCinstallation.) ODBC software includes one or more database drivers, plusan ODBC manager utility.</p><p><strong>ODBC on Windows systems</strong></p><p>Windows systems include the MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Components) package as part of the standard system installation. To configure ODBC on Windows systems, use the ODBC Data Sources control panel.</p><p><strong>ODBC on Mac OS X systems</strong></p><p>OS X includes iODBC software as part of the standard system installation. To configure ODBC on OS X systems, use the ODBC Administrator application in the Utilities folder.</p><p><strong>ODBC on Linux systems</strong></p><p>LiveCode supports iODBC and UnixODBC on Linux systems. You can downloadthe iODBC software from the iODBC web site at <em><a href="http://www.iodbc.org/">http://www.iodbc.org/</a></em>.You can download the unixODBC software from the unixODBC web site at<em><a href="http://www.unixodbc.org">http://www.unixodbc.org</a></em>.</p><p><strong>Creating a DSN for ODBC access</strong></p><p>Once you have installed the necessary software, you use the ODBC managerto create a DSN, which is a specification that identifies a particulardatabase.</p><p>You use the DSN to connect to the database via ODBC. The followingexample opens a connection to a database whose DSN is named &quot;myDB&quot;:</p><pre><code>get revOpenDatabase(&quot;ODBC&quot;,&quot;myDB&quot;,,&quot;jones&quot;,&quot;pass&quot;)</code></pre><p>One of the advantages of setting up a DSN is that if you wish to changethe location of the database, you only have to edit the DSN settings,not your application code. You can think of a DSN as a kind of shortcutor alias to your database.</p></body></html>
