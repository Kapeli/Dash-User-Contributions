Even if you aren&#39;t creating a traditionalmultimedia application, many applications require a compelling userinterface.</p><p>This chapter details LiveCode&#39;s media support. We discuss the imagefeatures and capabilities: how to import and export images in a varietyof formats, how to manipulate images within LiveCode, working withmasks, the clipboard and screen capture, right through to animated GIFs.We detail the vector graphic features and explain how to manipulatevector graphics by script. We then cover the video and audio featureset. Then we show you how to create custom themed buttons. Finally wegiven an overview of the support for visual transition effects.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Bitmap Images" class="dashAnchor"></a>Bitmap Images</h2><p>LiveCode supports a wide variety of image formats, including the popularPNG and JPEG formats. PNG images are space efficient and have fullsupport for alpha channels. JPEG images are good for displaying photos.For more details see the table below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Format</th><th>Export</th><th>Mask</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>PNG</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes, 1-bit or alpha channel</td><td>Supports gamma adjustment, supports alpha channels, supports interlacing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>JPEG</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Supports progressive JPEGs; lossy compression. Export allows you to set the level of compression</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GIF</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>1-bit</td><td>GIF87a and GIF89a; supports animation; supports interlaced GIFs; maximum 256 colors</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BMP</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Uncompressed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PBM</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>1-bit (black and white)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PGM</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Grayscale</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PPM</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>XBM</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>XPM</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>1-bit (black and white)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>XWD</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PICT</strong></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>uncompressed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see from the table above, a number of the supported imageformats can also be exported by LiveCode.</p><p>You can modify images using LiveCode&#39;s paint tools, or manipulate thebinary data by script or using an external.</p><p>You can create images from any of LiveCode&#39;s native objects, includingbuttons, fields and graphics. These can then been exported in a numberof formats. You can copy images from the clipboard or export images tothe clipboard.</p><p>LiveCode can capture a portion of the screen, or the entire screen.</p><h3>Importing Images</h3><p>To import an image, choose File -&gt; Import As Control -&gt; Image File.Select the image file you want to import. This will import the imagefile into a new image object on the current card. This is equivalent toexecuting the <strong>import paint</strong> command in the Message Box.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to reuse an image throughout your application,for example as part of a custom skin for your application, create asubstack and import all your images into that. You can then referencethem throughout your stack file. For more information, see the sectionCreating Custom Skins, below.</p></blockquote><h3>Importing Referenced Images</h3><p>To reference an image file on disk choose File -&gt; New ReferencedControl -&gt; Image File. This creates an image object on the current cardand sets its <strong>fileName</strong> property to the path of the image file youselected. Referenced images do not expand the size of your stack and areonly loaded from disk into memory when you navigate to the current cardor otherwise display them on screen. Referenced images are ideal whereyou want to update the image in an image editor and see the changes inLiveCode without having to re-import.</p><p>You may wish to consider creating a folder next to your stack file tocontain image files then using the Inspector to modify the file path tothe image to be a referenced path. This allows you to move the stack andfolder of images together onto a different system. for more informationon referenced file paths, see the section <em>File Name Specifications andPaths</em>.</p><p>You can use the standalone builder to copy referenced images into adirectory (updating each image&#39;s <strong>fileName</strong> property) or to copyreferenced images into your stack. For more information see the chapter<em>Deploying your Application</em>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> You cannot use the paint tools or manipulate the binarydata of referenced images. You must import them first. If you want tomodify the original file, you can make changes then export the image –see below for more details.</p></blockquote><h3>Import using Screen Capture</h3><p>To import an image by capturing a portion of the screen, choose File -&gt;Import As Control -&gt; Snapshot. Select the region of the screen you wantto import.</p><p>To take a screen capture by script, use the <strong>import snapshot</strong> command.To specify a section of the screen to import from without displaying thecrosshairs use <strong>import snapshot from rect</strong>:</p><pre><code>import snapshot from 100,100,200,200</code></pre><p>This will create an image object on the current card from therectangular area specified.</p><h3>Creating Images</h3><p>To create an image, drag an image object from the Tools palette to yourstack. You may now paint on the image using the paint tools, set the<code>fileName</code>reference to an image or manipulate the binary data of theimage.</p><h3>Using the Paint Tools</h3><p>To access the paint tools, press the fold out triangle at the bottomright of the Tools palette.</p><p><img src="images/image119.png" alt=""/></p><p>Figure 85 – The Graphic Tools</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Tool</th><th>Usage</th><th>Keyboard Modifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="images/image120.png" alt=""/></td><td>Select</td><td>Drag to select a rectangular area of an image</td><td>Shift constraints to a square; command / control duplicates selection</td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/image121.png" alt=""/></td><td>Bucket</td><td>Fills shapes with color.

If the filled option is chosen the beginning and end of the curve are joined automatically when you finish drawing</td><td>Alt / option prevents drawing line border; control creates transparency</td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/image131.png" alt=""/></td><td>Pencil</td><td>Draw a single-pixel-width freehand line</td><td>Control creates transparency</td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/image132.png" alt=""/></td><td>Brush</td><td>Draw brush strokes using the brush shape</td><td>Control creates transparency; command click to magnify</td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/image133.png" alt=""/></td><td>Fill (brush) color</td><td>Select a color to fill shapes or use with the brush tools</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/image134.png" alt=""/></td><td>Line color</td><td>Select a color to draw lines or use with the pencil tool</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/image135.png" alt=""/></td><td>Brush shape</td><td>Choose a brush shape for use with the brush, eraser and airbrush tools</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>To magnify an image, right click it with the pointer tool and chooseMagnify from the menu.</p><p>When you edit an image, it will be recompressed into the formatspecified by the <strong>paintCompression</strong> global property.</p><h3>Scripting with the Paint Tools</h3><p>Painting by script can be useful if you want the user to be able to seeeach paint action. If you want to manipulate the data of an image moreefficiently off screen, see the next section.</p><p>To control the paint tools by script, create an image then choose thepaint tool you want to use. Set the appropriate brush, pattern or linesize then use the drag command to paint.</p><p>The following example creates an image, chooses the brush tool, selectsa small circular brush shape, selects a red color, then draws a line:</p><pre><code>-- set the size of the image set the rect of the templateImage to 100,100,400,400 create image choose brush tool set the brush to 8 set the brushColor to red -- could use an RGB triplet here set the dragSpeed to 20 -- very slow drag from 120,120 to 300,300</code></pre><p>For more information, see the entries for the <strong>templateImage</strong>,<strong>tool</strong>, <strong>brush</strong>, <strong>brushColor</strong>, <strong>brushPattern</strong>, <strong>dragSpeed</strong>,<strong>penColor</strong> and <strong>penPattern</strong> in the <em>LiveCode Dictionary</em>.</p><p>You may reduce the size of an image using the <strong>crop</strong> command.</p><p>You may rotate an image using the <strong>rotate</strong> command.</p><p>To adjust the quality of the scaling algorithm used when scaling animage, set the <strong>resizeQuality</strong> property before setting the image&#39;srect.</p><h3>Manipulating Binary Image Data</h3><p>To manipulate the binary data of an image, use the image&#39;s <strong>imageData</strong>property. This property returns the color and transparency value of eachpixel in the image in a consistent format regardless of the format theimage is saved in. The <strong>imageData</strong> is stored as binary, with each pixel represented by 4 bytes. To convert it to and from RGB values use the <strong>byteToNum</strong> and <strong>numToByte</strong> functions.</p><p>For example, the numeric value of the red, green and blue channels respectively for the tenth pixel are given by the expressions:</p><pre><code>charToNum(char (4 * 9 + 2 of the imageData of image &lt;image&gt;)charToNum(char (4 * 9 + 3 of the imageData of image &lt;image&gt;)charToNum(char (4 * 9 + 4 of the imageData of image &lt;image&gt;)</code></pre><p>To manipulate the binary data of an image using an external, use the<strong>imagePixMapID</strong> property.</p><p>When you set the <strong>imageData</strong> of an image the image will be recompressed into the format specified by the <strong>paintCompression</strong> global property.</p><h3>Rendering an Image from Objects</h3><p>Use the <strong>import snapshot</strong> command to create an image from objects or aregion of a stack. Instead of specifying a rectangle in globalcoordinates (as described above) specify a stack or object.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike screen capturing, the stack or object you specify toimport an image from does not need to be displayed on screen. You cancreate a layout off screen in an invisible stack then render it intoan image.</p></blockquote><p>To import a snapshot of a region of a stack:</p><pre><code>import snapshot from 100,100,200,200 of stack &quot;Layout&quot;</code></pre><p>To import a snapshot of an object:</p><pre><code>import snapshot from button 5 of stack &quot;objects&quot;</code></pre><p>The import snapshot command creates a new image in the current<strong>defaultStack</strong>. The image is encoded using the current<strong>paintCompression</strong> format.</p><p>To save this snapshot directly to a file instead of creating an image,use the export snapshot command: </p><pre><code>export snapshot from the selectedObject to file &quot;snap.jpg&quot; as JPEG</code></pre><h3>Exporting Images</h3><p>To export an image in the current format that it is stored in, put itinto a binary file using the URL commands. The following example promptsthe user to select a file then export the image into it:</p><pre><code>ask file &quot;Select a file:&quot; put image &quot;picture&quot; into URL (&quot;binfile:&quot; &amp; it)</code></pre><p>To export an image in a different format, use the <strong>export</strong> command.</p><pre><code>export image &quot;picture&quot; to file &quot;picture.png&quot; as PNG</code></pre><p>You may also export an image to a variable. See the <strong>export</strong> commandin the <em>LiveCode Dictionary</em> for more information.</p><h3>Copying and Pasting Images</h3><p>To copy an image internally without using the system clipboard, simplyput it into a variable or into another image.</p><pre><code>put image 1 into image 2</code></pre><p>To recompress the image in a different format, use the <strong>export</strong>command to export it to a variable then put that variable into an image.</p><p>To copy an image to the clipboard, use the <strong>copy</strong> command.</p><pre><code>copy image 1</code></pre><p>To paste an image from the clipboard, use the <strong>paste</strong> command.</p><p>To transfer the binary data of an image to and from the clipboard getand set the <strong>clipBoardData[&quot;image&quot;]</strong> property. See the <strong>clipBoardData</strong> entry in the <em>LiveCode Dictionary</em> for more information.</p><h3>Working with Animated GIFs</h3><p>You can import an animated GIF image in the same way you import otherimages.</p><p>Set the <strong>repeatCount</strong> property to specify how often to play theanimation. Setting the <strong>repeatCount</strong> to 0 pauses the animation andsetting it to -1 causes it to repeat forever.</p><p>To change the current frame set the <strong>currentFrame</strong> property.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use an animated GIF as a button icon, it will playsimultaneously in each button it is used for.</p></blockquote><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Working with Vector Graphics" class="dashAnchor"></a>Working with Vector Graphics</h2><p>In addition to bitmap graphics, LiveCode also supports vector graphics.You can create vector graphics using the graphics tools, or by script.You can manipulate them interactively in the IDE or by script. You canrelayer them, export a description of them or convert them to bitmapformat.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Animation Engine is a 3<sup>rd</sup> party library thatincludes a set of functions for programming interactive graphicanimations. See the Related Software section of our web site for moreinformation.</p></blockquote><h3>The Vector Graphic Tools</h3><p>To see the graphic tools, unfold the triangle at the bottom right of thetools palette. The graphics tools are located above the paint tools onthe tools palette. The graphic tools operate in the same way as thepaint tools, except that each time you draw a shape a new graphic objectis created. Unlike paint graphics, you can resize and adjust graphicobjects after you have created them. For more information on theindividual shapes, see the section on <em>Paint Tools</em>, above.</p><h3>Creating Graphics by Script</h3><p>To create graphics by script, set properties of the <strong>templateGraphic</strong>then use the <strong>create graphic</strong> command. For more information ontemplate objects, see the section <em>Creating objects off screen using thetemplate objects</em> in Chapter 7.</p><h3>Manipulating graphics by script</h3><p>Because each graphic is an individual object, you manipulate itsappearance by setting properties rather than using the drag commands (aswith the paint tools, above). You can control all properties of thegraphic object by script including the rectangle, line and fillproperties. You can change a graphic from one type to another (e.g. arectangle to an oval) by setting its <strong>style</strong> property.</p><p>The polygon style of graphic has a <strong>points</strong> property which allows youto set the individual points of a line.</p><p>Simple motion can be applied using the <strong>move</strong> command. For example, tomove a graphic 100 pixels to the right asynchronously:</p><pre><code>move graphic 1 relative 100,0 without waiting</code></pre><p>For more information, see the <strong>move</strong> command in the LiveCodeDictionary.</p><p>To program a more complex animation effect, calculate the changes to thepoints or rectangles and set these values using timer based messaging.The following example scales a graphic named &quot;rectangle&quot; down by 100pixels over the course of 1 second.</p><pre><code>local sCounton mouseUp     put 0 into sCount     scaleGraphic end mouseUpon scaleGraphic     add 1 to sCount     if sCount &gt; 100 then exit scaleGraphic    get the rect of graphic &quot;rectangle&quot;     add 1 to item 1 of it     add 1 to item 2 of it     subtract 1 from item 3 of it     subtract 1 from item 4 of it     set the rect of graphic &quot;rectangle&quot; to it     send &quot;scaleGraphic&quot; to me in 10 milliseconds end scaleGraphic</code></pre><p>See the section on <em>Timer based messaging</em> for more information on usingtimers.</p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Working with Video" class="dashAnchor"></a>Working with Video</h2><p>LiveCode supports playback of video with the player object. On Windows<em>DirectShow</em> is supported. Media format support in the new Windows player control depends on which codecs are installed. A list of the<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms787745(VS.85">file formats and compression types available as standard</a>.aspx)on Windows is available in the MSDN documentation</p><p>On Mac OS X systems, the player object uses the AV Foundation framework.</p><p>On Linux Systems, the player object can play back video using <em>mplayer</em>.There are some functionality limitations: the <strong>alwaysBuffer</strong>, <strong>startTime</strong>, <strong>endTime</strong>, <strong>showController</strong> and <strong>playSelection</strong> properties have no effect, and <strong>play step forward</strong>/**play step back** do not work reliably.</p><p>In addition to these features, LiveCode has built-in support for theanimated GIF format. Animated GIF files can be played back without3<sup>rd</sup> party software. See above for more information. Otherformats supported by plug-ins in web browsers can be played back usingrevBrowser (e.g. Flash). See the topic on <em>revBrowser</em> for moreinformation.</p><h3>The Player Object</h3><p>Use the player object to play and interact with video and audio. Tocreate a player object, drag one onto your stack from the Tools palette.To select a movie file to play, open the Inspector for the player objectand select a file to use as the source. Doing this sets the player&#39;s<strong>fileName</strong> property.</p><p>To <em>stream</em> a movie from an Internet server, set the fileName propertyto the URL address of the stream.</p><p>To play a player, use the <strong>start</strong> and <strong>stop</strong> commands.</p><pre><code>start player 1 stop player 1</code></pre><p>The following table describes commonly used player properties:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Function</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>alwaysBuffer</strong></td><td>Forces the player to be buffered, allowing objects to be drawn on top and the current frame to be printed</td><td><code>set the alwaysBuffer of player 1 to true</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>showController</strong></td><td>Shows or hides the player controller</td><td><code>set the showController of player 1 to false</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>currentTime</strong></td><td>Sets the current frame</td><td><code>set the currentTime of player 1 to 1000</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>duration &amp; timeScale</strong></td><td>The duration of the movie and the number of intervals per second of a movie</td><td><code>put (the duration of me/the timeScale of me) into tRunTime</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>currentTimeChanged</strong></td><td>Message sent when the current frame changes</td><td><code>on currentTimeChanged pInterval</code><br><code>put pInterval into field &quot;Time Code&quot;</code><br><code>end currentTimeChanged</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>startTime</strong></td><td>The start time of the selection</td><td><code>set the startTime of player 1 to 500</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>endTime</strong></td><td>The end time of the selection</td><td>`set the endTime of player 1 to 1000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>showSelection</strong></td><td>Show the selection in the controller</td><td><code>set the showSelection of player 1 to true</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>playSelection</strong></td><td>Play only the selection</td><td><code>set the playSelection of player 1 to true</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>playRate</strong></td><td>The speed to play the movie.

Use theaudio clip when you need basic audio playback on systems that do nothave any of the 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries supported by the playerobject installed.</p></blockquote><h3>Importing an Audio Clip</h3><p>To import an audioClip choose File -&gt; Import as Control -&gt; Audio File.This will import the selected audio file into the current stack as anaudioClip.</p><h3>Playing an Audio Clip</h3><p>To play an audio clip:</p><pre><code>play audioClip 1</code></pre><p>To stop playing</p><pre><code>play stop</code></pre><p>To set the volume:</p><pre><code>-- sets the volume to 50% set the playLoudness of audioclip 1 to 50</code></pre><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Working with Visual Transition Effects" class="dashAnchor"></a>Working with Visual Transition Effects</h2><p>LiveCode supports visual transition effects when changing card or hidingand showing objects. There are three types of effect support: built-ineffects which work on all platforms, QuickTime effects which work onolder Mac OS X systems and Core Image effects which workon Mac OS X.</p><p>Use the <strong>visual effect</strong> command to display a visual effect. To go tothe next card with a dissolve transition effect:</p><pre><code>visual effect dissolve slow go next card</code></pre><p>To make changes to objects on the screen with a visual effect (e.g.hide, show or move them), first lock the screen, then make the changes,then unlock the screen:</p><pre><code>lock screen hide image 1 show image 3 unlock screen with visual effect &quot;wipe right&quot;</code></pre><p>To choose a QuickTime effect using the effect chooser dialog use:</p><pre><code>answer effect -- store the visual effect as a custom property set the cEffect of this stack to it</code></pre><p>Then:</p><pre><code>visual effect (the cEffect of this stack) go next card</code></pre><p>For more information on visual effects, see the <strong>visual effect</strong>command in the <em>LiveCode Dictionary</em>. To try out the different visualeffects available in an interactive format see the <a href="http://www.runrev.com/developers/exploring-revolution/%0Amultimedia/">MultimediaWorkshop</a></p><h2><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Creating Custom Skins" class="dashAnchor"></a>Creating Custom Skins</h2><p>In addition to its support for system native controls, LiveCode allowsyou the ability to create an entirely custom look, or skin, for yourapplication. All of the built-in elements can be replaced with themedgraphics allowing you to create rich multimedia. For example, LiveCodebuttons support &quot;icons&quot; of unlimited size which can be used to replacethe native appearance of a button entirely. Windows can be irregularlyshaped and even contain holes and alpha mask (variable) transparency.All of LiveCode&#39;s objects support a variety of transfer modes or inks.Stacks can take over the entire screen or be displayed with a backdrop.</p><h3>Custom Themed Buttons</h3><p>To create a custom button, first create a regular button. Open the<em>Inspector</em> for the button and set its style to <em>Transparent</em>. Turn offthe <em>Show Name</em> property. Next, switch to the <em>Icons &amp; Border</em> pane inthe Inspector. Turn off the <em>Hilite Border</em> property. You can now selectany image you have imported to use as an icon for the button. To set themouse down state, set the <em>hilite</em> icon. To set the roll over state setthe <em>hover</em> icon.</p><p>A button &quot;icon&quot; may be an image of any size in LiveCode, allowing acompletely custom look.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To use the same set of images as icons throughout your stackfile, create a substack and import all your theme images into it. Setthe ID property of each image to a high value (between 10,000 and100,000) so that it will be unique. You can now reference that imageanywhere in your application. If you want to change theme, you onlyneed to replace that image with another image and give it the same ID.</p></blockquote><p>Any object in LiveCode can behave like a button. For example, if youwant to create a graphic that responds when a user clicks on it, createthe graphic and add a <strong>mouseUp</strong> handler to it, in the same way you would with a button.</p><h3>Irregular Windows</h3><p>To create an irregularly shaped window, import or create an image thathas a transparency mask. Then use the <em>Stack Inspector</em> to choose thatimage as the stack&#39;s <em>Shape</em>. To change the shape by script, set the<strong>windowShape</strong> property. Many modern window managers support alphablended windows (variable degrees of transparency). To create a windowwith an alpha channel, import a PNG that contains an alpha channel andset the <strong>windowShape</strong> to this image.</p><h3>Blend Modes (transfer modes or inks)</h3><p>Blend modes determine how an object&#39;s colors combine with the colors ofthe pixels underneath the object to determine how the object&#39;s color isdisplayed. To set the blend mode of an object, use the <em>Blending</em> panein the <em>Inspector</em> or set the object&#39;s <strong>ink</strong> property. All objects inLiveCode support blend modes, with the exception of stacks.</p><pre><code>set the ink of image &quot;picture&quot; to &quot;blendBurn&quot;</code></pre><p>For more information, see the <strong>ink</strong> entry in the LiveCode Dictionary.</p><p>To set the degree of transparency, set the object&#39;s **<code>blendLevel</code>**property. All LiveCode objects (including stacks) support <code>blendLevel</code>:</p><pre><code>set the blendLevel of button 1 to 50 -- sets a button to 50% transparent</code></pre><h3>Full screen mode</h3><p>A stack can be displayed as full screen by setting its <strong>fullScreen</strong>property to true:</p><pre><code>set the fullScreen of this stack to true</code></pre><p>Set this property back to <code>false</code> to exit full screen mode.</p><p>If you want to hide or show the menu bar on Mac OS X use the <strong>hidemenuBar</strong> or <strong>show menuBar</strong> commands.</p><p>Similarly, use <strong>hide taskbar</strong> and <strong>show taskbar</strong> on Windows systemsto hide and show the taskbar.</p><h3>Displaying a Backdrop</h3><p>To display a backdrop set the <strong>backDrop</strong> global property. You may setthe backDrop to a solid color or to the ID of an image.</p><pre><code>set the backDrop to &quot;black&quot;</code></pre><p>To remove the <strong>backDrop</strong>:</p><pre><code>set the backDrop to none</code></pre></body></html>
