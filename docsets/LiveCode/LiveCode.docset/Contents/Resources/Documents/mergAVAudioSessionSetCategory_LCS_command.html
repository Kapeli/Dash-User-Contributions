Thiscategory is also appropriate for “play along” style apps, such asa virtual piano that a user plays over iPod audio. When you use thiscategory, audio from other apps mixes with your audio. Your audio issilenced by screen locking and by the Silent switch (called theRing/Silent switch on iPhone). </li><li>solo ambient :  The default category; used unless you set a category</li><li>playback :  For playing recorded music or other sounds that arecentral to the successful use of your app. When using this category,your app audio continues with the Silent switch set to silent or whenthe screen locks. (The switch is called the Ring/Silent switch oniPhone.) This category normally prevents audio from other apps frommixing with your app&#39;s audio. </li><li>record :  For recording audio; this category silences playback audio.Recording continues with the screen locked. </li><li>play and record :  Allows recording (input) and playback (output) ofaudio, such as for a VOIP (voice over IP) app. Your audio continueswith the Silent switch set to silent and with the screen locked. (Theswitch is called the Ring/Silent switch on iPhone.)This category isappropriate for simultaneous recording and playback, and also forapps that record and play back but not simultaneously. If you want toensure that sounds such as Messages alerts do not play while your appis recording, use the &quot;record&quot; category instead.This categorynormally prevents audio from other apps from mixing with your app&#39;saudio unless pMixWithOthers is true. </li><li>audio processing :  For using an audio hardware codec or signalprocessor while not playing or recording audio. Use this category,for example, when performing offline audio format conversion. Thiscategory disables playback (audio output) and disables recording(audio input). Audio processing does not normally continue when yourapp is in the background. However, when your app moves to thebackground, you can request additional time to complete processing. </li><li>multi-route :  Allows you to output distinct streams of audio data todifferent output devices at the same time. For example, you would usethis category to route audio to both a USB device and a set ofheadphones. Use of this category requires a more detailed knowledgeof, and interaction with, the capabilities of the available audioroutes. This category may be used for input, output, or both. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>pMixWithOthers</td><td></td><td><p>(optional with &quot;false&quot; default)  Setting this propertyto true allows audio mixing with other apps. Other aspects of thesecategories, such as their Silent switch behavior, are not affected. (Theswitch is called the Ring/Silent switch on iPhone.) When the audiosession category changes, such as during an interruption, the value ofthis property reverts to false. To regain mixing behavior you must thenre-set this property.  - true - false</p></td></tr><tr><td>pDuckOthers</td><td></td><td><p>(optional with &quot;false&quot; default)  For audio sessioncategories that allow audio mixing with other apps, specifies whetherother audio should be reduced in level when your app produces sound.This property has a value of false by default. When your app is finishedplaying sound, be sure to set this property back to false to removeducking.  - true - false</p></td></tr><tr><td>pAllowBluetooth</td><td></td><td><p>(optional with &quot;false&quot; default)  Allows a pairedBluetooth device to appear as an available audio input route. Bydefault, the value of this property is false. This property can be usedto modify the &quot;record&quot; or &quot;play and record&quot; categories. Attempting toset this property to true will fail for all other categories. Thisproperty affects the &quot;play and record&quot; category as follows: If the audioinput to the device is coming from a Bluetooth headset, setting thisproperty to true results in audio output also going to the Bluetoothheadset.  - true - false</p></td></tr><tr><td>pDefaultToSpeaker</td><td></td><td><p>(optional with &quot;false&quot; default)  Specifies whether ornot to route audio to the speaker (instead of to the receiver) when noother audio route, such as a headset, is connected. By default, thevalue of this property is false. This property retains its value throughan audio route change (such as when plugging in or unplugging aheadset), and upon interruption; it reverts to its default value onlyupon an audio session category change. This property can be used onlywith the &quot;play and record&quot; category.  - true - false</p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><b>Values</b></td><td><table class="inner"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>return</td><td></td><td><p>an error message if setting the category failed</p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><b>Description</b></td><td><p>mergAV is an iOS and OS X 10.6+ external that adds functions andcommands related to the AVFoundation framework.
