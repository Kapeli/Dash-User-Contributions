LiveCode Docset
=======================


Complete Dash compatible version of the LiveCode API and Guides.

**Author:** [James Hale](https://github.com/jameshale)

## Description
The 9 release of LC is going through quite a reorganisation with respect to the documentation format and arrangement. 

However each entry within the 
documentation clearly states with the version of LC from which it applies as well as the Edition (Community, Community Plus, Indy or Business) of LC to which it applies. 

This documentation set will be updated with each release of the LC 9 dp series.

It will also be updated for bug fixes (mainly in formatting) as they become know to me.

The current version(1.3) has been compiled from the 9 Dp11 release. This will probably bee the last dp release in the 9 series.
Since dp10 there have been quite a few updates to the documentation.


## To generate your own docset

### Requirements


Copy of the [Make docset](http://livecodeshare.runrev.com/stack/845/Make-DocSet) stack

(Also available via "Sample Stacks" from within LiveCode.)

Copy of [LiveCode](http://downloads.livecode.com/livecode/) (Version 8.1.5 or higher)



### Instructions
Simply run the stack (instructions included) within the version of LiveCode you wish to have a docset for. Once completed a "LiveCode.docset" will be available to import into Dash.

### Note
The current docset version was ran against LC 9 dp10. Currently there are now just over 4100 entries included as opposed to less than 4000 for the LC 8 series.  Synonyms have now been collapsed into their "master" record.

Please report any discrepancies or misiing items.
