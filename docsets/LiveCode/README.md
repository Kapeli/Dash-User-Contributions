LiveCode Docset
=======================


Complete Dash compatible version of the LiveCode API and Guides.

**Author:** [James Hale](https://github.com/jameshale)

## Description
The 9 release of LC is going through quite a reorganisation with respect to the documentation format and arrangement. 

However each entry within the 
documentation clearly states with the version of LC from which it applies as well as the Edition (Community, Community Plus, Indy or Business) of LC to which it applies. 

This documentation set will be updated with each release of the LC 9 dp series.

It will also be updated for bug fixes (mainly in formatting) as they become know to me.


## To generate your own docset

### Requirements


Copy of the [Make docset](http://livecodeshare.runrev.com/stack/845/Make-DocSet) stack

(Also available via "Sample Stacks" from within LiveCode.)

Copy of [LiveCode](http://downloads.livecode.com/livecode/) (Version 8.1.5 or higher)



### Instructions
Simply run the stack (instructions included) within the version of LiveCode you wish to have a docset for. Once completed a "LiveCode.docset" will be available to import into Dash.

### Note
The current docset version was ran against LC 9 dp9. Currently there are just over 5600 entries included as opposed to less than 4000 for the LC 8 series.  This is mainly due to reorganization as well as explicit entries for synonyms. This will change over time.
