LiveCode Docset
=======================


Complete Dash compatible version of the LiveCode API and Guides.

**Author:** [James Hale](https://github.com/jameshale)

## Description
The 9.01 release of LC has now reached "Stable"  stage. 

Extensions (Widgets and Libraries) can now have their own guide files. These now appear after the other guides when the 'home' page of the docset is selected.

Each entry within the 
documentation clearly states with the version of LC from which it applies as well as the Edition (Community, Community Plus, Indy or Business) of LC to which it applies. 

This documentation set will be updated with each release of the LC 9 series where a documentation change occurs.

It will also be updated for bug fixes (mainly in formatting) as they become know to me.

The current version(1.7.1) has been compiled from the 9.01 stable release using "Make docset V3.1" (see below)
This version returned syntax coloring to the examples as well as enabled links for "Associations" entries.

## To generate your own docset

### Requirements


Copy of the [Make docset](http://livecodeshare.runrev.com/stack/845/Make-DocSet) stack

(Also available via "Sample Stacks" from within LiveCode.)

Copy of [LiveCode](http://downloads.livecode.com/livecode/) (Version 8.1.5 or higher, I suggest you use the very latest release whether dp or rc as these will have the most up to date documentation resources.)



### Instructions
Simply run the stack (instructions included) within LiveCode. Once completed a "LiveCode.docset" will be available for import into Dash.

### Note
The current docset version was ran against LC 9.01 stable. 
Documentation for LiveCode is continually being updated. As such there may still be some failings in the docs or some other type of error.

Please report any discrepancies or omissions in the DocSet to me.

Please report any errors or omissions in the actual docs to [Livecode](https://quality.livecode.com).
