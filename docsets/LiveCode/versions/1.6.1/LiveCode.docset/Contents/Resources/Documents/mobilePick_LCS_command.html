On the iPad, a standard pop-over ispresented to display a single column of data or a picker-wheel todisplay multiple columns of data. On Android, the default pop-up ispresented to display a single option picker.</p><h3>iOS Behavior</h3><p>There are three modes of operation for <a href="mobilePick_LCS_command.html">mobilePick</a>, depending on thevalues for <b>initialIndex</b>.</p><p>If all <b>initialIndex</b> values are non-zero, the operation acts as a wayto change an existing selection. The items specified by the initialindex are selected (checked or hilited on iPad if a single column isspecified). </p><p>If all <b>initialIndex</b> values are zero, the operation acts as a way toselect from lists of options with no items selected. The user is able tocancel the operation by clicking &#39;Cancel&#39; (iPhone) or touching outsideof the popover (iPad). If the operation is canceled, 0 is returned;otherwise the indexes to the selected items are returned. Anypicker-wheels that remain untouched by the user, in a group ofpicker-wheels are set to 1, indicating that the defaults have beenaccepted. </p><p>If some <b>initialIndex</b> values are zero and others are non-zero, theoperation acts in the same way as if all values are non-zero on theiPhone. Once the user selects the &#39;Done&#39; button, all values that wereset to 0 and were not updated by the users are automatically set to 1.On the iPad values that were initially set to 0 and were not altered bythe user are automatically set to 1 if at least one picker-wheel wasaltered. If the user does not alter the state of any picker-wheel on theiPad, then the initial settings are returned without alteration. Thisincludes any zeros that were initially set.</p><p>If the &#39;Cancel&#39; button is displayed, then any selection made by the usercan be canceled, returning 0.</p><p>If the &#39;Done&#39; button is displayed, then all 0&#39;s are returned if nodefault values were specified and the user did not make any selectionson the pickers.</p><h3>Android Behavior</h3><Blockquote><p><b>Warning:</b> No support is provided in LiveCode for multi column pickerson Android. This currently a limitation of Android.</p></Blockquote></td></tr></table></body></html>
