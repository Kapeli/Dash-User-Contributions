Each segment is identified either by a label, or an icon.</p><p><img src="27images/segmented.png" alt="Segmented Control widget"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Creating a Segmented Control" class="dashAnchor"></a>Creating a Segmented Control</h3><p>A segmented control widget can be created by dragging it out from the Tools Palette, where it appears with the following icon:</p><p><svg viewBox="0 0 150 30" style="display:block;margin:auto" width="auto" height="50">  <path d="M72.6,0H7.7C3.4,0,0,3.4,0,7.7v14c0,4.2,3.4,7.7,7.7,7.7h64.9c4.2,0,7.7-3.4,7.7-7.7v-14C80.2,3.4,76.8,0,72.6,0z M7.8,13.5h8v2.3h-8V13.5z M19.7,20.6h-12v-2.3h12V20.6z M19.7,11h-12V8.8h12V11z M27.8,25.5h-1V3.8h1V25.5z M46.1,20.6h-12v-2.3h12V20.6zM36.1,15.7v-2.3h8v2.3H36.1z M46.1,11h-12V8.8h12V11z M54.4,25.5h-1V3.8h1V25.5z M72.7,20.6h-12v-2.3h12V20.6z M72.7,15.7h-8v-2.3h8V15.7z M72.7,11h-12V8.8h12V11z" /></svg></p><p>Alternatively it can be created in script using:</p><pre><code>create widget as &quot;com.livecode.widget.segmented&quot;</code></pre><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Examples" class="dashAnchor"></a>Examples</h3><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Controlling Text Alignment" class="dashAnchor"></a>Controlling Text Alignment</h3><p>One of the ways the segmented control is used in the LiveCode IDE is to control the alignment of text.  You can find it used in that way on the Property Inspector’s “Text” page for the Field control, for example.</p><p><img src="27images/pi-text.png" alt="Use in the property inspector"/></p><p>To build a similar control, create a new stack and drag a field and a segmented control onto it from the tools palette.</p><p>Open the Property Inspector for the segmented control, and set the “Display style” (the itemStyle property) to “icons”.  This will display an icon for each segment, instead of a textual label.  The segmented control is set up with the text alignment icons that you need by default.</p><p>Next, set the “Segment names” to “left”, “center” and “right”.  This <code>itemNames</code> property allows you to associate a value or tag with each segment, separately from the text that’s displayed on the control. The<br/><code>itemNames</code> and <code>itemLabels</code> can be thought of as as values that have meaning to the app and to the user respectively. The segment names and labels are similar to the tags and labels used by LiveCode menus.</p><p>Finally, you need a script for the segmented control.  When the user changes the highlight of the segmented control by clicking on one of the segments, it sends the <code>hiliteChanged</code> message, and your script should handle this message to change the field’s <code>textAlign</code> property.</p><pre><code>on hiliteChanged   set the textAlign of field 1 to the hilitedItemNames of meend hiliteChanged</code></pre><p><img src="27images/text-align.png" alt="Segmented control to set text align"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/A 5%2Dstar Rating Control" class="dashAnchor"></a>A 5-star Rating Control</h3><p>By adding some script support, you can use the segmented control to create some controls that would be quite difficult to do using “classic” LiveCode controls.  For example, you can build a “5 star rating” control quite quickly.  When you click on a segment, the control will display filled stars for the segment you clicked on and all the segments to the left, and empty stars for all the segments to the right.</p><p>Create a new segmented control, set it to display icons, and give it 5 segments.  Next, go to the “Icons” pane of the Property Inspector.  Set all the “Segment icons” (the <code>itemIcons</code> property) to the “empty star” icons, and all the “Hilited segment icons” (the hilitedItemIcons property) to the “star” icon.  You should now be able to click on individual segments to have them turn from an empty star to a full star.</p><p>To get the star rating to work properly, however, it’ll be necessary to allow multiple segments to be highlighted. You can do this on the “Basic” pane of the Property Inspector by enabling the “Multiple hilites” (<code>multipleHilites</code>) property.</p><p>The colors can be changed on the “Colors” pane of the Property Inspector.  Change the “Hilited segment label color” (<code>hilitedTextColor</code>) to blue, and the the “Selected segment color” (<code>hiliteColor</code>) to the same grey background colour as used for the “Segment color” (<code>backColor</code>).</p><p>The final part is to add a script that hooks this all together, and makes sure that the correct segments are highlighted when the user clicks on the control by responding to the <code>hiliteChanged</code> message. The <code>hilitedItems</code> property contains the segment numbers that are highlighted.</p><p>The script first checks which segment was clicked, and then creates a new value for the <code>hilitedItems</code> that includes all the segments up to and including the clicked segment.</p><pre><code>local sRatingon hiliteChanged   local tHilited   -- Find the rightmost item that changed.  This is   -- the segment that the user clicked   put the hilitedItems of me into tHilited   repeat with tSegment = the itemCount of me down to 1      if tSegment is among the items of tHilited then         if tSegment &gt; sRating then            put tSegment into sRating            exit repeat         end if      else         if tSegment &lt;= sRating then            put tSegment into sRating            exit repeat         end if      end if       end repeat   -- Highlight all the segments up to and   -- including the one that was clicked   local tNewHilite   repeat with tSegment = 1 to sRating      put tSegment &amp; comma after tNewHilite   end repeat   -- Remove trailing comma   delete char -1 of tNewHilite   set the hilitedItems of me to tNewHiliteend hiliteChanged</code></pre><p><img src="27images/star-rating.png" alt="A 5-star rating control"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Additional Uses" class="dashAnchor"></a>Additional Uses</h3><p>There are many other good uses for the segmented control: you can use it for switching between cards, as a row of options that can be toggled, or possibly even to create an upvote/downvote control in a forum comment-viewing app.</p></body></html>
