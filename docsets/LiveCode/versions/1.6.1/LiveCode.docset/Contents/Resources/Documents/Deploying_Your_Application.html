Users who do not have LiveCode can run these applications like any other application they download and install. Standalone applications can have their own identity as true applications, include a desktop icon, document associations and more.</p><p>You can also create applications for iOS, android, and HTML5. Please consult the separateguides for information on how to deploy to these platforms.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Building a Standalone Application" class="dashAnchor"></a>Building a Standalone Application</h3><p>When you have finished your LiveCode application and what to distribute it you can build it into a standalone application. These applications do not require users to have LiveCode.All of LiveCode&#39;s feature set is available for use in a standalone application, with the exception that you cannot set scripts on objects.</p><p>The builder itself will let you build standalone applications for any platform it supports, from any platform it supports (for example you can build a Windows standalone on a Mac OS X machine). However, you may wish to check that your application looks and behaves correctly on each platform you intend to support. Please note it is inherently harder to debug an application that has been built as a standalone, so you should test your application as thoroughly as possible before building it.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Standalone Applications Settings" class="dashAnchor"></a>Standalone Applications Settings</h3><p>The Standalone Applications Setting dialog allows you to create settings for your standalone application. This dialog can be found in the File menu. The settings you enter are applied to the current front most editable stack and are saved with the stack. This means you only need to enter the settings once for each application you create. The same settings will apply if you do another build in the future.</p><p><img src="images/standalone-settings-general.png" alt=""/></p><p>Figure 1 – Standalone Settings – General Tab</p><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Mode Selector</strong></td><td>Choose between the different standalone application settings screens.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Standalone Name</strong></td><td>Set the name of your standalone application. This should be the name you want your finished application to have. Don’t include a file extension (.exe on Windows or .app on Mac OS X) as the standalone builder can create standalones for multiple platforms and will add the appropriate extension automatically.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Inclusions Selector</strong></td><td>Choose the components you want to include in a standalone. You may either choose to search for required inclusions automatically, or manually select the components you want to include.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Search for Inclusions</strong></p><p>This is the default option. When selected, LiveCode will search your application stack file (main stack and sub stacks) to attempt to determine what components your application uses. It will then include those items.</p><p><strong>Select Inclusions for the Standalone Applications</strong></p><p>Select this option if you want to specify the components to include manually. You may wish to use this option if your application dynamically loads components that cannot be searched at this point automatically, or if you know exactly what components your application uses and wish to speed up the standalone building process by skipping the automatic search step.</p><p>It is important that you choose to include all the components that your application uses or it may fail. If you do not include your own custom error reporting or LiveCode’s standalone error reporting dialog (discussed below) such failure may be silent – i.e. an operation in your standalone will simply cease working without displaying anything to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |</p><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Profiles Settings</strong></td><td>Choose between the Property Profile settings options.

Select this option if you do not want the names you have selected for stacks to be visible to the end user in the filing system.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Create folder for stackfiles</strong></td><td>Creates a folder and places the stack files into that folder, instead of storing them at the same level as the standalone executable. All references in the <code>stackFiles</code>property will refer to this folder using a relative path so the stacks can still be located by the standalone application.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Individual stack options</strong></td><td>Select a stack file on the left then an individual stack from within the file to set options on that stack.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Set destroyStack to true</strong></td><td>Set this option if you want the selected stack file to be removed from memory when it is closed. This option is useful if you are loading large stacks into memory and want them to be removed when they are closed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Encrypt with password</strong></td><td>Secures the scripts within the selected stack file with a password. This provides a basic level of encryption that prevents someone from casually reading the scripts in the stack by opening the file in a binary file viewer.</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> A stack file directly attached to a standalone application cannot have changessaved to it. This stack is bound directly to the executable file that runs. The OS locks an executable file while it is running. If you want to save changes in your standalone application, split your stack up until multiple files. A common technique is to create a &quot;splash screen&quot; stack that contains a welcome screen and then loads the stacks that make up the rest of your application. These stacks are referenced as <code>stackFiles</code>on this pane in the standalone settings screen. It is thus possible to automatically update these component stacks, or to save changes to them. You may also want to consider creating preference files in the appropriate location on your end user&#39;s system (see the <code>specialFolderPath</code>function and query/setRegistry functions for more information).</p></blockquote><p><img src="images/standalone-settings-copy-files.png" alt=""/></p><p>Figure 3 – Standalone Settings – Copy Files</p><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Non-stack files in the application</strong></td><td>List other files to be included in the standalone.
