If you&#39;d like to run it in 64-bit mode, right-click on the app bundle, select &quot;Get Info&quot; and deselect the &quot;Open in 32-bit mode&quot; option. In future, we will add a menu item in the IDE that re-launches the IDE in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode, as appropriate.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/How to deploy a 64%2Dbit Mac standalone" class="dashAnchor"></a>How to deploy a 64-bit Mac standalone</h3><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Building" class="dashAnchor"></a>Building</h3><p>The MacOS pane of the Standalone Settings includes two checkboxes to indicate what engines you&#39;d like to include in the standalone. The current default is 32-bit only but this can be changed to 64-bit only or 32-bit/64-bit Universal binary. If both engines are included, only one app bundle is produced containing both engines. The app will then run in 64-bit mode on 64-bit machines or 32-bit mode otherwise.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Testing" class="dashAnchor"></a>Testing</h3><p>If you have built a 32-bit only or 64-bit only standalone, the app will always run in that mode. If you have a Universal standalone containing both, you can force the app to run in 32-bit mode on 64-bit machines by right-clicking the app bundle, selecting &quot;Get Info&quot; and then enabling the &quot;Open in 32-bit mode&quot; option.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Reporting bugs" class="dashAnchor"></a>Reporting bugs</h3><p>Please report bugs to the <a href="http://quality.livecode.com/">LiveCode Quality Centre</a>.  Make sure you select the correct engine type when prompted - 32-bit or 64-bit.</p></body></html>
