It is more important to beat a friend’s score thanto merely achieve a decent score! Game Center embraces this idea in theform of challenges. Players on Game Center can challenge other GameCenter members to beat earned scores or achievements. Challengesrepresent a different style of multiplayer experience where playerscompete against each other indirectly.<b>/p</b><b>p</b>When a challenge is issuedby one player to another, a push notification is sent to the challengedplayer. The player can accept or refuse the challenge. If the playeraccepts the challenge, the challenge is placed on a list of challengesassociated with that player. Later, if the player beats the challenge,Game Center notifies both the challenged player and the challenger thatthe challenge is complete.<b>/p</b><b>p</b>Game Center supports two kinds ofchallenges:<b>ul</b><b>li</b>A score challenge is issued based on a leaderboardscore previously earned by the challenger. The challenge is completedwhen the challenged player earns a better score. When the challengedplayer beats a score challenge, Game Center automatically issues a newscore challenge to the original challenger. Score challenges continue topass back and forth between the two players as they work to beat eachother’s scores.<b>/li</b><b>li</b>An achievement challenge is issued from anachievement that the challenger has already completed. The challenge iscompleted when the challenged player completes theachievement.<b>/li</b><b>/ul</b> </p></td></tr><tr><td><b>Tags</b></td><td>externals</td></tr></table></body></html>
