It can also be set to a local file url.</p><p>Alternatively the <code>htmlText</code> property can be used to render specific chunks of html within the browser object. </p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Controlling Navigation" class="dashAnchor"></a>Controlling Navigation</h3><p>The browser sends the following messages which can be used to control navigation within the browser. See the API documentation for more details:</p><ul><li>browserDocumentLoadBegin</li><li>browserDocumentLoadComplete</li><li>browserDocumentLoadFailed</li><li>browserFrameDocumentLoadBegin</li><li>browserFrameDocumentLoadComplete</li><li>browserFrameDocumentLoadFailed</li><li>browserNavigateBegin</li><li>browserNavigateComplete</li><li>browserNavigateFailed</li><li>browserUnhandledLoadRequest</li></ul><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Interacting With JavaScript" class="dashAnchor"></a>Interacting With JavaScript</h3><p>The browser allows two-way interaction with the javascript running in the displayed page. To allow LiveCode handlers to be called from JavaScript, there is a <code>javascriptHandlers</code> property. This can be set toa list of LiveCode handlers which appear as methods attached to a global <code>liveCode</code> object. You can call these methods as you would any other JavaScript function and pass whatever parameters you require.</p><p>In the other direction, you can use the <code>do in widget</code> command to execute JavaScript statements in a browser widget. For example:</p><pre><code>-- Use JavaScript to hide &quot;myButton&quot; in the page displayed in a browser widget.do &quot;document.getElementById(&#39;myButton&#39;).hidden = &#39;hidden&#39;&quot; in widget &quot;myBrowser&quot;</code></pre></body></html>
