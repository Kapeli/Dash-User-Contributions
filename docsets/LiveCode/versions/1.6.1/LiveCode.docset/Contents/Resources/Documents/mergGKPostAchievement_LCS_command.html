If a player hasmultiple devices, your game on another device can retrieve theplayer’s progress towards achievements. Your game reports theplayer’s progress by using a floating-point percentage, from 0.0 to100.0, that represents how much of the achievement the player hascompleted. You decide how that percentage is calculated and when itchanges. For example, if the player earns an achievement simply fordiscovering a location in your game, then you would simply report theachievement as 100 percent complete the first time you report progressto Game Center. On the other hand, for an achievement like “Capture 10pirates”, your reporting mechanism increments by 10 percent each timethe player captures a pirate.<b>/p</b><b>p</b>When you report progress to GameCenter, two things happen: <b>ul</b><b>li</b>If the achievement was previouslyhidden, it is revealed to the player. The achievement is revealed evenif your player has made no actual progress on the achievement (apercentage of 0.0).<b>/li</b><b>li</b>If the reported value is higher than theprevious value reported for the achievement, the value on Game Center isupdated to the new value. Players never lose progress onachievements.<b>/li</b><b>li</b>When the progress reaches 100 percent, theachievement is marked completed, and both the image and completeddescription appear when the player views the achievementsscreen.<b>/li</b><b>/ul</b> </p></td></tr><tr><td><b>Tags</b></td><td>externals</td></tr></table></body></html>
