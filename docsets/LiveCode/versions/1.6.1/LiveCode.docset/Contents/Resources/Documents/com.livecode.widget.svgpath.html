Setting either the <code>iconPresetName</code> property or the <code>iconPath</code> property will override any setting of the other property. The <code>iconPresetName</code> is one of the preset icons which can be listed using the <code>iconNames()</code> function, or selected via the property inspector. Clicking the currently set icon in the property inspector will bring up the icon picker, allowing you to pick one of the preset icons. Setting one of the preset icons will cause its iconPath property to be set to the path of the current icon. If there is no preset path that fulfils your requirements then you’ll have to set the <code>iconPath</code> property to the SVG path of the image you want. Some information on extracting valid SVG paths from images are discussed at the end of this post.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Highlighting" class="dashAnchor"></a>Highlighting</h3><p>The <code>hilite</code> property can be used to alter the appearance of the svg path widget to indicate it has been clicked, for example. The fill color of a highlighted svg path widget is determined by its <code>hiliteColor</code>.Although this effect can also be achieved by changing the <code>foreColor</code> property, the advantage of setting the <code>hilite</code> property is that the <code>hiliteColor</code>, if empty, will be inherited. Thus you can ensure consistency of highlight colors by setting the <code>hiliteColor</code> of the group or stack containing the widget.</p><p><img src="8images/hilite.png" alt="Hilited SVG Path widget"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Rotation and Reflection" class="dashAnchor"></a>Rotation and Reflection</h3><p>The <code>angle</code> property can be used to rotate an svg path. This can be handy if you need to tweak one of the preset paths, for example to make a finger point at something from a slightly different direction:</p><p><img src="8images/rotated.png" alt="Rotated SVG Path widget"/></p><p>The <code>flipped</code> property can be used similarly. For example, here it is used in conjunction with the <code>angle</code> property to make a fire extinguisher icon face the other way.</p><p><img src="8images/fireext.png" alt="Flipped SVG Path widget"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Aspect Ratio" class="dashAnchor"></a>Aspect Ratio</h3><p>The <code>maintainAspectRatio</code> property determines whether the path is stretched to fit the object bounds or not. For example, the cube icon will always be a cube if <code>maintatinAspectRatio</code> is true, but can be stretched to a cuboid if not.</p><p><img src="8images/aspect.png" alt="SVG Path widget maintain aspect ratio"/></p><p>## Fill RuleSVG paths can cross over themselves, which causes an ambiguity when determining what exactly constitutes the interior of the path (for filling purposes). The <code>fillRule</code> property controls how the engine chooses what to fill. Take for example a five-pointed star, defined in a simple way using a moveTo command and five lineTo commands, e.g.</p><pre><code>M4,47h117l-95,69 36-111 36,111z</code></pre><p>The two available fill rules work by determining how many path segments are crossed by a straight line going infinitely in one direction from a given enclosed region. Using the above example, starting anywhere inside the central pentagon of the star, such a line would always cross 2 path segments. The ‘even odd’ fill rule states that a region should be filled if this number is even, and not filled if it is odd. The ‘non-zero’ fill rule states that a region should be filled if this number is non-zero.</p><p>So for the five-pointed star example above, we have the following results:</p><p><img src="8images/fill-rule.png" alt="SVG Path widget fill rule"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Width and Height" class="dashAnchor"></a>Width and Height</h3><p>All LiveCode objects have width and height properties, and the SVG path widget is no different. However, these do not necessarily reflect the actual bounds of what is drawn – for example if the <code>maintainAspectRatio</code> property is set to true, as can be seen in the cube / cuboid example above, there may be a significant difference. The SVG path widget has read-only <code>scaledWidth</code> and <code>scaledHeight</code> properties which return the width and height of the path as it is currently being rendered.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/How to Get SVG Paths" class="dashAnchor"></a>How to Get SVG Paths</h3><p>Many image manipulation programs allow images to be exported as SVG, and there are many SVG files available online, for example at Open Clipart, however these cannot always be converted into simple SVG paths.</p><p>If an SVG file consists of a simple polyline element, you can often convert it to the correct form by putting M (moveTo command) before the first co-ordinate, L (lineTo command) before the second co-ordinate, and adding Z (closePath command) at the end. This works for example when creating a polyline svg using an online drawing website such as Vector Paint.</p><p>See the following forum post for more information on extracting simple paths from SVG files: <a href="http://forums.livecode.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=27202">http://forums.livecode.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=27202</a></p></body></html>
