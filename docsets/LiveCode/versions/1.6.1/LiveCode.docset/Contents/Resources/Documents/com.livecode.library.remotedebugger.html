The script editor opens, and you can control execution in the standalone using the standard step out/over/in, stop and play buttons.</p><p>You can hover over variables in the script editor to view their values,</p><p><img src="21images/se-hover.png" alt="Script editor variable hover"/></p><p>see all the variables in the current debug context in the variable viewer pane,</p><p><img src="21images/se-variableviewer.png" alt="Script editor variable viewer"/></p><p>and output the values of variables to the message box using <code>put tVar</code>.</p><p><img src="21images/msg.png" alt="Message box"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Using the Remote Debugger" class="dashAnchor"></a>Using the Remote Debugger</h3><p>If you are using the ‘Test’ button to run your app from the IDE, the remote debugger will be included in the app automatically. Otherwise, if you are saving a standalone, simply include the remote debugger in your standalone application using the Inclusions pane of the standalone settings stack.</p><p><img src="21images/inclusions.png" alt="Including the remote debugger"/></p><p>When the standalone launches, if there is an instance of the IDE running, it will start a remote debugging session automatically. Whenthere is a remote debugging session running, it is indicated by a greenplay indicator on the menu bar&#39;s Test button.</p><p><img src="21images/active.png" alt="Remote debugger active"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Debugging Other Platforms" class="dashAnchor"></a>Debugging Other Platforms</h3><p>The standalone you are debugging does not have to be running on the same platform as your IDE. You can debug LiveCode applications running on iPhone / iPad simulators and devices, Android emulators and devices, and virtual machines.</p><p>This means in particular it is possible to debug code paths that do not actually run on the local machine, such as <code>orientationChanged</code> handlers when a device is turned.</p><p><img src="21images/orientation-android.png" alt="Android orientation change"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Remote Logging" class="dashAnchor"></a>Remote Logging</h3><p>The remote debugger will route any <code>put</code> commands without a target into the IDE message box. So if you have any such commands for logging purposes, you will be able to see the output in the IDE.</p></body></html>
