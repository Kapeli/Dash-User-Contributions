If you open up the property inspector for the navigation bar, you can change both of them.</p></blockquote><p><img src="22images/pi.png" alt="Navigation Bar property inspector"/></p><p>The text that is actually displayed for a navigation item, provided the display style is either “text” or “both”, is the label.</p><p><img src="22images/label.png" alt="Navigation Bar property inspector"/></p><p>The value of the <code>hilitedItemName</code> property is the name of the currently highlighted navigation item. This allows multiple items to have the same label and still be distinguishable from script.</p><p>When using the navigation bar in this way, the simplest thing to do is to put the widget into a group and set the group to behave like a background. This will ensure the navigation bar is automatically placed on new cards of the stack. This is how the navigation bar is used (in conjunction with the header bar widget) in the interactive tutorial app.</p><p><img src="22images/bmi-app.png" alt="Navigation Bar used in BMI app"/></p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Customising a Navigation Bar" class="dashAnchor"></a>Customising a Navigation Bar</h3><p>Individual properties of each navigation item, and the order they are displayed, can be changed using the property inspector.</p><p><img src="22images/pi-editor.png" alt="Navigation Bar property inspector editor"/></p><p>When one of the icons is clicked, a scrollable icon picker is popped up to allow you to choose a new icon. The current selection is highlighted as shown.</p><p><img src="22images/icon-picker.png" alt="Navigation Bar icon picker"/></p><p>The icon and highlighted icon can be different, to allow further visual feedback about what is currently selected. One way of using this is to turn the navigation bar as a single-selection option control, as might be used in a multiple choice quiz app.</p><p><img src="22images/multiple-choice.png" alt="Navigation Bar multiple choice editor"/></p><p><img src="22images/multiple-choice-1.png" alt="Navigation Bar multiple choice one"/></p><p><img src="22images/multiple-choice-2.png" alt="Navigation Bar multiple choice two"/></p><p>The colors of the navigation bar are controlled by the <code>foreColor</code>, <code>backColor</code>, <code>borderColor</code>, and <code>hiliteColor</code> properties as usual for LiveCode controls.</p><h3><a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Guide/Scripting" class="dashAnchor"></a>Scripting</h3><p>Aside from responding to a change in the highlight using the <code>hiliteChanged</code> message, there is generally not very much that requires scripting when using the navigation bar. However, each of the various aspects of the navigation bar items’ display (icon, highlighted icon, label) can be set individually from script using the <code>itemLabels</code>, <code>itemIcons</code> and <code>hilitedItemIcons</code> properties. The values of these properties are just comma-delimited lists. It can be handy to write utility functions to set these if you are going to do so often, for example:</p><pre><code>command setLabelAtIndex pLabel, pIndex  local tLabels  put the itemLabels of widget &quot;navbar&quot; into tLabels  put pLabel into item pIndex of tLabels  set the itemLabels of widget &quot;navbar&quot; to tLabelsend setLabelAtIndex</code></pre><p>Alternatively, it is possible to set all the data of the navbar at once, using the itemArray property.</p><pre><code>local tNavItemsput &quot;Contacts&quot; into tNavItems[1][&quot;label&quot;]put &quot;contacts&quot; into tNavItems[1][&quot;name&quot;]put &quot;user&quot; into tNavItems[1][&quot;icon_name&quot;]put &quot;user&quot; into tNavItems[1][&quot;hilited_icon_name&quot;]...set the itemArray of widget &quot;navbar&quot; to tNavItems</code></pre></body></html>
