CallingEditFieldText will trigger additional messages related to field editing.Scenario 1: Pass in one parameter If you just pass in pField and leavepIndex and pKey empty then the data grid behaves as follows: </p><ol><li>Creates field editor </li><li>Assign text of pField to field editor </li><li>Sends preOpenFieldEditor pFieldEditor to pField. </li></ol><p>pFieldEditor is the long id of the field editor created in step 1. When editing stops (focus leavesfield, user presses escape key, etc.) the message DeleteFieldEditor issent to the data grid. This in turn sends CloseFieldEditor pFieldEditorto pField if the user changed the content or ExitFieldEditorpFieldEditor if no change was made. You can use these messages to saveany changes the user made in pFieldEditor. Scenario 2: Pass in all threeparameters If you pass in all three parameters (pField, pIndex, pKey)then the data grid will automatically save any changes made whileediting. The new value will be assigned to the key pKey for index pIndexin the dgData array of the data grid. In this scenarios CloseFieldEditorpFieldEditor and ExitFieldEditor pFieldEditor are still sent. Thedifference is that after CloseFieldEditor is sent to pField the contentsof pFieldEditor are saved in the dgData. If for any reason you do notwant the data to be saved then you can return &quot;cancel&quot; fromCloseFieldEditor. Note: If the user presses the tab key while editingand the autotab property of pField is true then the messageOpenNextFieldEditor pDirection is sent to pField. If you don&#39;t handlethis message and the data grid is a table then the data gridautomatically opens the next cell for editing. For data grid forms youcan handle this message in order to open another field for editing. Youcould call EditKeyOfIndex for Example. Note 2: The default behavior for</p><p>pFieldEditor is located in button &quot;Field Editor&quot; of stack&quot;revDataGridLibrary&quot;. If you want to override this behavior then you canassign the behavior of pFieldEditor to another button in thepreOpenFieldEditor message.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
