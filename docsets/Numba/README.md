* Docset description from [its official website](http://numba.pydata.org):

  > Numba gives you the power to speed up your applications with high performance functions written directly in Python. With a few annotations, array-oriented and math-heavy Python code can be just-in-time compiled to native machine instructions, similar in performance to C, C++ and Fortran, without having to switch languages or Python interpreters.
  >
  > Numba works by generating optimized machine code using the LLVM compiler infrastructure at import time, runtime, or statically (using the included pycc tool). Numba supports compilation of Python to run on either CPU or GPU hardware, and is designed to integrate with the Python scientific software stack.
  >
  > The Numba project is supported by Anaconda, Inc. (formerly known as Continuum Analytics) and [The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (Grant GBMF5423)](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/gordon-and-betty-moore-foundation-grant-numba-and-dask).

## Complete instructions on how to generate the docset

1. Install [`doc2dash 2.2.0`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/doc2dash), [`Sphinx 1.6.2`](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), and of course, the latest version of [numba](https://pypi.org/project/numba/).

2. Otimize `Numba.docset` for display in Dash: There is an option called `'navbar_fixed_top': "true",` in [`theme.conf`](https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/blob/master/sphinx_bootstrap_theme/bootstrap/theme.conf) of [Sphinx Bootstrap Theme](https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme), download and change it to `'navbar_fixed_top': "false"` and install the theme, then use command `doc2dash` (see step 3) to generate the html pages. This will help the docset pages look better in Dash.

3. You should download the repository from [here](https://github.com/numba/numba), or just run

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:numba/numba.git /path/you/want/to/clone/to
    ```

    to clone the repo to your local machine. Then run

    ```shell
    cd numba/docs
    make html
    cd _build/html
    # In this folder, execute
    doc2dash -n Numba -u http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/<downloaded-numba-version>/ -v -A -i ../../_static/numba_blue_icon_rgb.png .
    ```

4. Set an index page: Add these lines to `/path/to/Numba.docset/Contents/Info.plist`:

    ```xml
    <key>dashIndexFilePath</key>
    <string>index.html</string>
    ```

    After adding the index, remove and re-add the docset in Dash's Preferences.

5. Compress: go to `/path/to/Numba.docset`, run command

    ```shell
    tar --exclude='.DS_Store' -cvzf Numba.tgz Numba.docset
    ```

    to generate `Numba.tgz`.

6. Move `Numba.tgz` to `/path/to/cloned/Dash-User-Contributions/docsets/Numba`, here we called it *top-level compressed docset*.

7. Create a folder under path `Dash-User-Contributions/docsets/Numba/versions/<downloaded-numba-version>/`.

8. Make a copy of "top-level compressed docset", move it to `versions/<downloaded-numba-version>/` for users to download the versions they want. But all of those compressed docsets should have the name `Numba.tgz`! Donâ€™t worry, they are not in the same folder.

9. Edit `docset.json` accordingly. Make sure to follow the same naming rules as the sample.

10. Edit the `README.md`.

11. Submit a pull request.
