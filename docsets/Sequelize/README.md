Sequelize
=======================
Made by marudor (https://github.com/marudor / https://twitter.com/marudor)

Initial Documentation straight from the Sequelize repository (https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)
Currently there still is a Table of Content within the HTML - this will change.
Not every method is indexed yet.

This is mainly to provide a very basic offline Documentation for Sequelize.
