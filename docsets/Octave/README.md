[Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a programming language for matrix mathematical calculations. It is very similar to [MatLab](http://www.mathworks.de/products/matlab/) and its syntax is almost interchangable. I use Octave at university for _Machine Learning_ and _Speech Processing_ calculations.
