Hiero 1.9v1 Docset
=======================

Creator: [Alex Widener](http://www.github.com/alexwidener)

Used: [doc2dash](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash) on Ubuntu14.04 (had to install dependencies manually)
Dependencies are in [doc2dash's setup.py](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash)

Location of initial HTML: The Foundry has an incorrect link up right now, so it's stored locally in the Hiero install.

Running: doc2dash -n Hiero

Since The Foundry doesn't have an online set up (or hasn't fixed the URL yet, I've contacted them), I didn't set it up to have an online redirect.
I'll change that in the next version, provided they update their own website.
