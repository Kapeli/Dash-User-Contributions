Apache Hive
=======================

This docset is maintained by Wei Zhang(https://github.com/wezhang). It was generated from the Apache Hive Documents Website (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/).

The docset is generated by my homemade Nodejs script, you can clone it from https://github.com/wezhang/docsets-hive

And run --

```
npm install
gulp -p hive
```

Everything is done.

## Known issues

 - Currently, all indexes are typed as Instruction, which be added more types later.
