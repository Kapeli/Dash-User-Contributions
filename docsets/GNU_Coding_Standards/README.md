GNU Coding Standards Docset
===========================

This docset is basically a copy of the GNU Coding Standards (HTML format). The
script and Makefile to generate the docset can be obtained from
<https://github.com/lshprung/gnu-coding-standards-dash-docset>.

This is the work of Louie Shprung. Where to find me:
