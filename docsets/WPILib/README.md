## Generate the Docset
  1. Follow the steps [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc) to install and configure Visual Studio Code for programming for "Java teams" (skip steps for "C++ teams") and then installing the WPILib java library, which comes with javadocs automatically.
  2. See these [instructions](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/272787-frc-java-wpilib-api-documentation) for how to access the WPIlib javadocs, installed in step 1.
  3. Use [javadocset](https://github.com/Kapeli/javadocset) to generate the Dash docset, using the docs you found in step 2.

Additionally, the javadocs can be found posted officially online: http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/
