MOS Protocol 2.8.5 Docset
=========================

Author
------

The MOS Protocol documentation for version 2.8.5 is available as a Word-exported-to-HTML-file on
[mosprotocol.com](https://mosprotocol.com/wp-content/MOS-Protocol-Documents/MOS_Protocol_Version_2.8.5_Final.htm).

This docset was handcrafted from that documentation by [Markus Birth](https://twitter.com/mbirth)
using a text editor and SQLite database tool.


Notes
-----

The HTML generated by Word is an utter mess no automated tool could make sense of.
Various anchors were missing or in the wrong place. You WILL have to spend a few hours if you
attempt to create this docset from scratch.

Other current versions (3.x, 4.x) of the MOS Protocol documentation can be
found [here](http://mosprotocol.com/current-version/).
Older version documentation is [here](http://mosprotocol.com/current-version/prior-versions/).
