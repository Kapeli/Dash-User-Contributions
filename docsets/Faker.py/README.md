# Faker Docset

[Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) is a Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.

Faker is heavily inspired by PHP Faker, Perl Faker, and by Ruby Faker.
