Intel Intrinsics
================

Contributed by Andreas Fredriksson (@deplinenoise on Twitter + GitHub)

Based on the Intel Intrinsics Guide
(https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/) - specifically
the data XML file that can be downloaded manually from there.

GitHub repo for my docset separately: https://github.com/deplinenoise/sse-docset

To regenerate the docset from scratch:
- Install Perl 5.18.0 or later, and the Template module.
- Grab a new data-3.x.x xml file from the intel site (see AJAX source for URL)
- Run intel-intrinsics-to-html.pl data-3.x.x.xml

IntelIntrinsics.docset is fully generated by the above steps.

Known limitations:
- The throughput data is not being output at the moment.
