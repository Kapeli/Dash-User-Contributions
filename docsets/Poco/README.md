Poco
=======================

### Known issue
1. Some `Class` and `Namespace` definitions in index page may show as `Function`. This situation does not result in a decrease in overall availability.
2. Version `1.10.1` formatting is brocken. See also [#3838](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-User-Contributions/issues/3838). This will be fixed in the future.

### Build Notes
This is a docset generated by [technosophos's dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing). Generation requirements list below.

1. Latest version of dashing (not prebuilt version!)
	If you have **Go 1.11** or later installed, run: (Why highlight this version explains below)
	```sh
	go get -u github.com/technosophos/dashing
	```
	> According to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25908, old version of golang will lead to a insidious bug.

2. Download the official web SDK reference to your build directory:
	```
	wget -c -r -np -k -L -p https://pocoproject.org/docs/
	```

3. Copy the `dashing.json` file to your build dir and run:
	```
	dashing build
	```

4. The built docset could not pass [Docset Contribution Checklist
](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-User-Contributions/wiki/Docset-Contribution-Checklist) at first, course `class ` prefix will be added to every class tag. You could use an sqlite client to run:
	```sql
	update searchindex name = replace(name, 'class ','');
	```

5. done

### Known Issue
No official `icon@x2.png` is provided by Poco project. The default 32x32 icon is replaced by 16x16 icon.
