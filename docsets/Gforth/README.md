Gforth Docset for Dash
======================

Created by Darren Stone ([@emptybits](https://twitter.com/emptybits)).

[Gforth](http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/) is the [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) implementation of the GNU project. This docset works with [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash).  

The docset is generated from Gforth HTML documentation. As of version 0.7.0, it includes 809 Keyword entries (one for each Gforth word) and 90 Section entries (one for each topic or section in the Word Index).

The [source for this docset](https://github.com/bitmason/gforth-docset) includes the original Gforth HTML docs (under GNU Free Documentation License 1.1) and a Gforthdoc2set.py script that generates the docset from that HTML.
